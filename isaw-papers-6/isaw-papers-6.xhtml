<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p id="p0" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p0"><span class="reference" rel="dcterms:references" typeof="dcterms:Location"><a rel="rdfs:isDefinedBy" href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/599587" property="rdfs:label">Delos</a></span>, home of the sanctuary of Apollo since the archaic period, underwent a period of rapid economic development after 167 BCE, when the Romans put the island under Athenian dominion and turned it into a commercial base between the East and the West. Due to its advantageous geographical position, Delos had attracted traders from Greece, Macedonia, and the Hellenistic East as well as dealers from Rome since the third century BCE. In between 167 BCE and the sacks of 88 and 69 BCE, the island, though primarily addressing the regional market of the Cyclades, became an intermediary step in Rome’s commercial relations with the Hellenistic east.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref1" href="#endnote1">1</a></sup> The accelerated urbanization, attested by the formation of new neighborhoods and the maelstrom of redevelopment in the existing urban and port areas of the island, as seen in the massive constructions of docksides, warehouses and markets, was the result of this economic development and the unprecedented demographic growth that it generated.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref2" href="#endnote2">2</a></sup> My study focuses on one of the newly-formed neighborhoods of Delos in this period, the Quartier du Stade. By analyzing the changes in the houses and the overall urban development of this neighborhood, my aim is to examine the relations between the forces that shaped the city of Delos in this period, such as economy, politics, ideology, and the major urban components, for example, architecture, landscape, infrastructure. In doing so I hope to address alternative ways of approaching the city in the ancient world. In this paper I outline the parameters of this research by addressing the religious and economic network of Delos and its subsequent appropriation in the late Hellenistic period, and present the preliminary results of my fieldwork on the Quartier du Stade in 2009 and 2010.</p>

<p id="p1" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p1">Although numerous archaeological excavations have probed the city of Delos for over a century and recent comprehensive studies have adjusted our understanding of Delian architecture,<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref3" href="#endnote3">3</a></sup> the nature and history of urbanism on Delos remains a surprisingly understudied topic. Only preliminary thoughts have been expressed on the urbanization of Delos,<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref4" href="#endnote4">4</a></sup> while the only comprehensive study on the urban growth of the island (Papageorgiou-Venetas 1981) has been rightly criticized for misapplying modern urban planning principles and quantitative methods.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref5" href="#endnote5">5</a></sup> Rather than providing an architectural history of the buildings or a <i>catalogue raisonnée</i>-style publication of one class of material culture, my project sets the larger goal of using the “Quartier du Stade” as a case study of rapid urbanisation.</p>

<p id="p2" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p2">Drawing on current developments and debates in the fields of Hellenistic economy,<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref6" href="#endnote6">6</a></sup> and contemporary urban studies,<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref7" href="#endnote7">7</a></sup> the project will address the relations between the forces that shaped urban growth and major components of the city texture on late Hellenistic Delos. Although this project focuses on a specific case study of urban growth, its ultimate goal is to offer an alternative way for approaching the urbanism of ancient cities. By examining the agents, relationships and consequences of the accelerated development of the late Hellenistic city of Delos this project will identify a model of urban growth that to date has been overlooked in the study of ancient cities that have focused on the idealized concepts of the Hellenistic and Roman urban environments, such as monumentality and town planning. The rapid urbanisation of Delos may be compared to far more accelerated developments of the growing commercial centres in Asia and the Gulf Region today. Historical paradigms of this model of informal urban growth will further the understanding of the ties between economic and urban developments today.</p>

<h2>Religious and economic network of Delos</h2>

<p id="p3" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p3">Delos was an important cult center from early on whose activity was inextricably linked to its economic role. Due to its advantageous geographical position in the center of the Aegean world, Delos commanded a huge cult network that intertwined religious with economic and political activities from the archaic period onwards. This network was primarily for the islanders but at times it was used to stake claims for the Ionian peoples, that is, one of three major linguistic/cultural groups of Hellenes. Communities competing for political power and leadership exploited the cult network of Delos over time: Ionians, Athenians, the successors of Alexander and finally Romans.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref8" href="#endnote8">8</a></sup></p>

<p id="p4" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p4">There are three key moments in the history of Delos that are relevant for my discussion of the urban growth on Delos: the first Athenian dominion, the period of independence and the second Athenian dominion. In 478 BCE, at a time of insecurity after the Persian Wars, the Athenians created a maritime confederacy with Delos as its seat and by the end of the fifth century BCE they resumed the administration of the sanctuary.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref9" href="#endnote9">9</a></sup><span > During this period, in 426 BCE, the Athenians purified the island; they removed tombs of all who had died on the island and issued a proclamation that in future none should be born or die on the sacred island; pregnant women and dying persons must be ferried across to Rheneia.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref10" href="#endnote10">10</a></sup><span > This important moment marked the character of the urban settlement on Delos and its subsequent growth. With no tombs to mark the limits of the city, Delos on the one hand evades traditional categories of the ancient city and on the other presents a unique opportunity to reexamine the factors that shape the ancient city.</span></p>

<p id="p5" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p5">Delos gained its independence in the early Hellenistic period, when the successors of Alexander distributed the provinces of Alexander’s empire. In between 315 and 313 BCE Antigonos Monophthalmos created the <i>koinon</i> of the Nesiotes, first confederacy of the islanders proper (versus the Ionians), and set Delos as its seat. The euergetism of the Antigonids modified the physiognomy of the sanctuary in this period; for instance the Portico of Philip V, king of Macedon, towards 210 BCE (GD 3), the South Portico, towards 250 BCE (GD 4), and the Portico of Antigonos Gonatas, king of Macedon, 250-225 BCE (GD 29).<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref11" href="#endnote11">11</a></sup> Furthermore, due to the increasing role of Delos as a commercial center of the Cyclades in this period, a multitude of cults is attested on the island: for instance, the cults of Egyptian gods (e.g., Serapeion A [GD 91], and Serapeion C [GD 100]) and the cults of the Syrian Gods (GD 98, Sanctuary of Syrian Gods).<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref12" href="#endnote12">12</a></sup></p>

<p id="p6" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p6">But
the prosperity of the Delian commerce began with the decision of the Roman Senate to make it a “duty free” port in 167 BCE under Athenian suzerainty. The senate guaranteed duty-free status to the port of Delos (through a grant of <span style='font-family:"New Athena Unicode";vertical-align:baseline'>ἀτέλεια)</span> prohibiting the Athenians from levying import and export duties on any of the trade passing through the harbor. This decision was taken at the end of the Third Macedonian War, in a series of conflicts fought by Rome in order to gain control of the Mediterranean basin. The Senate wished to destroy the commerce of <span class="reference" rel="dcterms:references" typeof="dcterms:Location"><a rel="rdfs:isDefinedBy" href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/590030" property="rdfs:label">Rhodes</a></span> – the major power in the Aegean. Indeed Rhodes experienced massive trade shrinkage at the end of the second century BCE.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref13" href="#endnote13">13</a></sup><span > The growing commercial importance of the island of Delos was not only a consequence of the grant of <i>ateleia</i> in 167 BCE, but also of other equally important developments such as the Roman destruction of <span class="reference" rel="dcterms:references" typeof="dcterms:Location"><a rel="rdfs:isDefinedBy" href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/314921" property="rdfs:label">Carthage</a></span> and <span class="reference" rel="dcterms:references" typeof="dcterms:Location"><a rel="rdfs:isDefinedBy" href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/570182" property="rdfs:label">Corinth</a></span>, the rapid collapse of the Seleucid empire in the latter half of the century and the creation of the Roman province of Asia in 129 BCE.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref14" href="#endnote14">14</a></sup><span > Strabo, a Greek geographer writing at the very beginning of the first century CE, says that the merchants (</span><span style='font-family:"New Athena Unicode";vertical-align:baseline'>οἱ ἔμποροι</span><span >) changed their place of business from Corinth to Delos following the destruction of the former in 146 BCE for two reasons: they were attracted first by </span><span style='font-family:"New Athena Unicode"; vertical-align:baseline'>τῆς ἀτελείας τοῦ ἱεροῦ</span><span style='vertical-align: baseline'> and second by the good location of the harbor, “as it is on the sea-route from Italy and Greece to Asia”</span><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"; vertical-align:baseline'> </span><span >(</span><span>Str. 10.5.4). Because Delos was a shrine, it had become an international town; because it was an international town, it became a place of commerce.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref15" href="#endnote15">15</a></sup></p>

<p id="p7" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p7">According to the
literary sources (Strabo, Pliny, Pausanias and Lucilius), slaves and luxury
goods from the Middle East were traded through Delos. Pausanias (3.23.3-6)
described Delos at this time as the trading station of all Greece. Pliny (<i>HN</i>
34.9) reported that the <i>mercatus in Delo</i> was <i>concelebrante toto orbe</i>,
more specifically after the development of the Roman shipping lane to Asia (so
after 133 BCE). The contemporary poet Lucilius referred to the mighty port of
Puteoli as “a lesser Delos” (Paulus, ex Fest. 88.4: <i>‘Minorem Delum’ Puteolos
esse dixerunt…unde Lucilius-- inde Dicarchitum populos Delumque minorem</i>
[=Lucil.118]). Strabo described Delos as the location of a trans-Mediterranean
slave trade to the agricultural estates, mines, shops and households of the
Roman West (Str. 14.5.2).<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref16" href="#endnote16">16</a></sup><span
> However, no physical remains have ever been
identified on the island to confirm the importance of the slave trade.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref17" href="#endnote17">17</a></sup><span >
Luxury items, such as perfumes, spices, unguents, incense, gems, statues,
metals, dyes, glass, tapestries, textiles and linens – all originating in the
Middle and Far East – were credited to the commerce of Delos including highly
prized Delian bronze statues</span> <span >(Plin.
<i>HN</i> 34.9):</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref18" href="#endnote18">18</a></sup><span
> sculptor ateliers, for instance the boutiques
on the south side of Agora of Italians (GD 52), fabrication of <i>auloi</i>,
for instance the boutique at the Monument du granit (GD 54).</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref19" href="#endnote19">19</a></sup><span >
Pliny reports that Delos became a production centre for the perfume trade, a
point reinforced by the number of <i>unguentarii</i> who are recorded amongst
Roman-Italian families on Delos whose professions are recorded in epigraphic or
literary evidence from Italy.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref20" href="#endnote20">20</a></sup><span
> <span>Since</span> the raw materials for this
manufacture had to be imported from further east, Pliny’s evidence confirms the
importance of oriental luxuries as a component of Delian trade. Archaeological
evidence also points to the existence of perfume, purple dye, glass jewelry,
sculpture and terracotta figurines production on Delos (purple-dye production: GD
79.1, GD 80.1 and at the bay of Fourni; perfumeries: GD 79, GD 66, GD 50, GD
120, GD 118; sculpture ateliers: shops 103 and 106 at SW corner of the Agora of
the Italians [GD 52]; glass production: shops to the west of the Maison des
Stucs [GD 87], south of the Samothrakeion [GD 93] and in the area of the
Aphrodision [88]; coroplastic workshops: shop at the south side of Agora of the
Italians [GD 52], Quartier du Théâtre, Insula VI, Maison B).</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref21" href="#endnote21">21</a></sup></p>

<h2>Demographic and urban growth</h2>

<p id="p8" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p8">From a population of about 1,500 to 2,000 in the period of the independence, it gained an estimated amount of roughly 15,000, during the period of the second Athenian dominion. It has been suggested that the island reached a population of 20,000 to 30,000 residents at its peak.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref22" href="#endnote22">22</a></sup><span> However there is no firm evidence – inscriptions give evidence for 1,200 citizens and a population of about 6,000 at the beginning of the first century BCE.<b> </b>During this period the island is characterized by its cosmopolitan character. The majority of the new residents of the island were from the eastern Mediterranean and the Italian peninsula.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref23" href="#endnote23">23</a></sup> <span >While some eastern merchants at Delos came from cities as close as western and southern Asia Minor, the majority came from places further abroad, including Antioch, Berytus, Tyre, Sidon, Alexandria, and from more exotic points still further east, such as Gadara, Heliopolis, Arabian Nabataea, Gerra on the Persian gulf and in one instance from as far away as Minaei in south Yemen.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref24" href="#endnote24">24</a></sup> <span >The largest ethnic contingent of the island was, however, Roman-Italian.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref25" href="#endnote25">25</a></sup></p>

<p id="p9" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p9">But whereas the occupation is so diverse the architecture is quite uniform, attesting to what has been termed an architectural koine. Contrary to later tendencies to “Romanize” settlements, what we see on the island is a total adaptation of the local building techniques with a religious/ethnic flavor attested in inscriptions, paintings and sculptures.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref26" href="#endnote26">26</a></sup><span> Recent studies have pointed that the contact of Roman with local cultures resulted in a plurality of hybrid cultural expressions, which defy the generalization that the term “Romanization” implies.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref27" href="#endnote27">27</a></sup><span> Here foreigners adopted the local architectural language and arranged their houses and religious club associations around a courtyard, while details in the decoration, such as statues and wall paintings, as well as inscriptions indicate their distinct identity. The House of Cleopatra (GD 119) that is occupied by an Athenian couple (Dioskourides and Cleopatra of the Myrrhinoutta demos – <i>ID</i> 1987) is not different from the House of the Trident (GD 118) that is occupied by a Syrian (indicated by protomes of the bulls of Hadad and the lions of Astargatis in the Rhodian peristyle of the house) or the House of the Dolphins (GD 111) that is constructed by a Phoenician (signature of the vestibule mosaic of the Tanit symbol). Equally homogenous in their architecture are the religious association of the Poseidoniastes from Berytos (GD 57) and the 25 houses with religious wall paintings in relation to the Roman cult of the <i>Lares Compitales</i>.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref28" href="#endnote28">28</a></sup><span> Only in a few cases (House of Diadoumenos, House of the Dolphins, and House of the Trident) the spatial arrangements of the house remind visual strategies of self-representation familiar from the slightly later houses in Campania. In these houses the alignment of the entrance corridor, whose floor featured an impressive emblema, with the peristyle and the façade of the <i>oecus maior</i> created a visual impact on the house’s interior to a passer-by, which owners could employ to enhance their personal status. The majority of the houses, however, follow the more traditional layout of the Greek house of rooms around a courtyard accessed by an ante-room, pastas or colonnade, which in some cases was appropriated, for example, the angle of the vestibule allowed passers-by to see into a part of the house, in order to accommodate the owners’ wish of self-representation.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref29" href="#endnote29">29</a></sup></p>

<p id="p10" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p10"><span >The rapid urbanization of the island took place in this period.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref30" href="#endnote30">30</a></sup> The small settlement of the period of independence, which clustered around the main sanctuary area with some smaller sanctuaries and cultural centers beyond, exploded during the period of the second Athenian dominion. The urbanization expanded from the area of the old sanctuary center outwards:</p>

<p id="p11" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p11"><span >1 - The new markets, the Agora of the Hermaistai or the Competaliastai (GD 2), the Agora of Theophrastos (GD 49) and the Agora of the Delians (GD 84), clustered at the borders of the sanctuary;</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref31" href="#endnote31">31</a></sup></p>

<p id="p12" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p12"><span >2 - the main port facilities expanded to the south and big storage facilities and facilities equivalent to shopping malls were created next to them.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref32" href="#endnote32">32</a></sup></p>

<p id="p13" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p13"><span >3 – the residential neighborhoods developed around the sanctuary center and where good natural ports were created to complement the activities of the main port, overloaded by the maritime traffic going through the island in this period.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref33" href="#endnote33">33</a></sup><span > The character of the neighborhoods was mixed: residences mingled with manufacturing activities, shops and storage facilities and were next to some locus of cultural activity, such as the gymnasia. </span></p>

<p id="p14" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p14"><span >The main residential neighborhoods that have been identified to date have been divided in two kinds, the so-called “old” and “new” neighborhoods.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref34" href="#endnote34">34</a></sup><span > The term “old” neighborhood is used for neighborhoods that developed in areas that were previously urbanized, for example, the Quartier du Théâtre and the Quartier de l’Inopos, and the term “new” neighborhood is used for areas that were not previously urbanized, for example, the Quartier de Skardhana (or Quartier Nord) and the Quartier du Stade. These new neighborhoods took over the areas of the gardens (</span><span style='font-family:"New Athena Unicode"'>κήποι)</span><span > and the open farming areas of the island to the north, which were concentrated at the south of the island in this period.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref35" href="#endnote35">35</a></sup><span > However, the full extension of the city is not well known as not all the areas of the island have been excavated.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref36" href="#endnote36">36</a></sup></p>

<p id="p21" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p21">The Quartier du Stade (figs. 1, 2 and 3), the focus of this study, is one of the newly-formed neighborhoods. It is located on the north-east side of Delos next to the Stadion, after which it is named. It was not as isolated from the sanctuary center as it may seem today. The Archegesion (GD 74), the sanctuary of the Archegetes/Anios, the mythical founder of the Delian city (first half of sixth century BCE),<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref37" href="#endnote37">37</a></sup> is located between the hippodrome and this neighborhood. It is also generally thought that the gardens mentioned in the accounts of the <i>hieropoioi</i> (near the Hippodrome, near the Neorion, near the palaestra) were located in this area.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref38" href="#endnote38">38</a></sup></p>

<p id="p22" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p22">The Stadion (GD 78) predates the neighborhood; it is mentioned in the accounts of
the <i>hieropoioi</i>, the annually appointed officials of the sanctuary, since
the first quarter of the third century BCE.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref39" href="#endnote39">39</a></sup><span >
The Gymnasion (GD 76) attached to the Stadion was built at the end of the
second or the beginning of the first century BCE (based on construction
evidence),</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref40" href="#endnote40">40</a></sup><span
> and the Xyston (GD 77) was dedicated by

<p id="p23" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p23"><span >Only a very small part of the neighborhood was excavated (<i>Insula</i> I and II) at the beginning of the 20</span>th<span > century (1912-13) by André Plassart, who published an extensive report of the excavations in 1916 – however, a full and detailed publication of the excavations did not follow.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref45" href="#endnote45">45</a></sup><span > More recently, in 1997, House IB was re-excavated and identified as a perfume workshop by Jean-Pierre Brun and Michèle Brunet.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref46" href="#endnote46">46</a></sup><span > Their study provides a relative chronology of the development of that house, which is helpful in the study of the overall neighborhood.

<p id="p24" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p24">From the two <i>Insulae</i>
that were exposed by Plassart’s excavation, we may infer that it was a
mixed-use residential and manufacturing neighborhood with some sale activities and
some storage facilities within the residential units. From the visible
remaining structures of the neighborhood facing towards the port, we can see
that there were no large storage facilities like the ones located to the south
of the main port; instead, the storage facilities were integrated in the
residential areas. <i>Insula</i> I presents a few shops, (α), (β) and (γ) at
its north end.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref48" href="#endnote48">48</a></sup> Aside from a modest house at the north (IA),
the rest of the buildings are quite big with courtyards: for instance, the
perfume workshop (IB) and Houses IE, IC and ID. <i>Insula</i> II has a shop at
the southwest corner (ζ, η, θ) and two houses with courtyards (IIA, IIB). Storage spaces were dispersed on the ground floor of the buildings. The character of this neighborhood is very similar to the other newly-formed neighborhood of the island, the Quartier de Skardhana, where we also have mixed residential, manufacturing and storage uses.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref49" href="#endnote49">49</a></sup> Industrial and commercial features are not completely unique to the newer neighborhoods, but also appear to some degree in the older neighborhoods, too; for example, one of Delos’ two excavated coroplastic workshops appeared in the heart of the Quartier du Théâtre,<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref50" href="#endnote50">50</a></sup> and there are numerous small shops throughout the island.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref51" href="#endnote51">51</a></sup> The upper floors, like all the houses of Delos, were the most opulent ones; for example, the surviving sculptures come from the upper floors and the remains of the walls from the upper floor feature polychrome decoration.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref52" href="#endnote52">52</a></sup></p>

<p id="p36" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p36"><span >During fieldwork seasons
2009-2010 I studied and conducted the architectural survey of Houses IC and ID at the Quartier du Stade (figs. 4 and 5),</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref66" href="#endnote66">66</a></sup> and examined the development of their construction history in relation to the urban fabric of the neighborhood and the port facilities that might have been attached to it (fig. 3).<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref67" href="#endnote67">67</a></sup> The architectural survey was carried out using a handheld digital laser distance measurer and an automatic optical level on a tripod for the distances up to 15 m as well as a total station for the larger distances.

<h2>Houses IC and ID</h2>
<div id="section5.1">
<h3>House IC <sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref68" href="#endnote68">68</a></sup></h3>

<p id="p37" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p37">In House IC the entrance was originally from <i>Rue Transversale</i> through room (e), on the south side of the house (fig. 4). In the second phase of the house, the entrance was from <i>Rue du Stade </i>through room (a), on the west side of the house, and an upper floor was added which was accessible by a staircase in room (a) (fig. 5).<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref69" href="#endnote69">69</a></sup> The reconfiguration of the entrance to the house led to rearrangements in the interior organization of the house. In order to facilitate the access to room (g) from courtyard (c) the opening in the center of the wall between these two spaces was closed and an opening at the west end of the same wall was made. In its original disposition this opening provided a more direct access from room (e) and, in its subsequent phase, it was more easily accessed by room (a). In this way, the architectural composition gravitated in the area that gave access between vestibule (a), courtyard (c) and room (g).</p>

<p id="p38" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p38">The two small rooms (e) and (f), once in the epicenter of the architectural composition and now leftovers, were used as storage spaces in this period – as the amphora sherds found in them suggest. The design practice of using such “leftover” rooms in the architectural composition as service rooms or rooms for storage is also noted in the other Quartiers on Delos, for example, rooms (a), (c) and (d) in the Maison du Lac (GD 64).<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref70" href="#endnote70">70</a></sup> Rooms (h) and (i) at the north end of the house are also possible storage spaces; the latter was not plastered (i) and a large clay pot was found in the former (h). The lack of plaster in room (i) suggests that it was allocated as a storage room or other type of service room throughout the history of the house. Room (h), however, may have been turned into a storage space only in the second phase of the house. Its relatively big size and location immediately after the <i>oecus maior</i> (room g) is a typical trait of evening reception rooms in the Delian houses.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref71" href="#endnote71">71</a></sup> The addition of the second floor in the second phase of the house, which was accessible from vestibule (a) and was associated with the change of the entrance from room (e) to (a), could explain the choice of the use of room (h) as a storage space at this time. By the construction of the second floor the lighting and ventilation of room (h) was reduced and the upper floor now offered more attractive alternatives for such reception rooms. The combination of these factors must have led to their conversion into storage spaces. The northeast area of room (g) also provided a place for storage. The east part of the north wall of room (g) featured two perpendicular shelf brackets at 1.20 m from the floor level that were placed at 1.07 m from each other.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref72" href="#endnote72">72</a></sup> The change of the entrance to room (g) from courtyard (c) from the center to the west end of the wall probably facilitated the use of the eastern part of room (g) as a service and storage area. It is possible that the change of the entrance was in fact conducted in order to make more effective use of space, as not much area was in this arrangement reserved for passage. It seems that the area north of the courtyard (rooms [g], [h] and [i]) was reserved for service rooms of the household in the second phase of the house, probably due to the reduction of light and ventilation, and could have operated as an independent unit that would have been rented out.</p>

<p id="p41" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p41"><span >Concerns of light and ventilation as well as stability seem to have preoccupied the architects of the house with the addition of the second floor. On the west wall of courtyard (c) a big window looking onto the street (Rue du Stade) was opened in the second phase. This wall, as well as its northern extension towards rooms (g) and (h), were originally built by a combination of mud and stone (in stone up to 1.40-1.60 m and then mud), and due to considerations in the need for load bearing support of the second floor in the second phase of the house they were altered to only stone. The addition in stone that replaced the mud part in the second phase is thinner than the lower part of the wall by 10-15 cm and forms a horizontal irregular line on the wall (fig. 6). Plassart had noted the difference in the thickness of the wall, but did not associate it with the replacement of the mud part with the addition of the second floor.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref73" href="#endnote73">73</a></sup><span> This wall formed the west façade of the house and flanked rooms (g) and (h) as well as courtyard (c). The wall is not interconnected with the north and south walls of rooms (g) and (h) and the addition of the second floor posed problems of stability for the mud part of the wall. A similar decision was taken in the case of room (a). In the first phase of the house, the south wall of room (a), which in the second phase became the entrance to the house, was also partially made of stone up to 1.90 m and then mud. The mud part of the wall was replaced with stone in the second phase.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref74" href="#endnote74">74</a></sup><span > In this case as well the mud wall was not sufficient to bear the load of the staircase going to the second floor that was added at this time. Mud walls were used extensively in the newly-formed neighborhoods of Delos and provide evidence for the quick construction that initially took place.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref75" href="#endnote75">75</a></sup></p>

<h3>House ID <sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref76" href="#endnote76">76</a></sup></h3>

<p id="p42" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p42">In House ID the ground floor area was also modified during a second phase of the house (figs. 4 and 5). The two large rooms, (j) and (n), were broken down into smaller rooms (j), (m), (t), (n), (o), (p) and (q).<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref77" href="#endnote77">77</a></sup> The creation of smaller rooms may be associated with both the need for storage as well as to provide bedrooms for the slaves of the house as Chamonard proposed.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref78" href="#endnote78">78</a></sup> Only rooms (k) and (l) provide archaeological evidence for use as storage spaces (amphora sherds).<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref79" href="#endnote79">79</a></sup> They are located in the more remote area on the ground floor of the house, which is also the case of the storage facilities in House IC (rooms [h] and [i] and east part of room [g]). Some of the other rooms (m, o, and t) had plain white decoration and featured niches (an architectural feature that would be used to place lamps).<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref80" href="#endnote80">80</a></sup> These rooms could have been used as service or slave rooms. Similar plain decorated rooms appear in the Quartier du Théâtre, for example room (g) in Maison du Trident (GD 118) and room (d) in Maison de Dionysos (GD 120), and it has been proposed that they were used as service or slave rooms.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref81" href="#endnote81">81</a></sup></p>

<p id="p45" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p45"><span >There might be, however, another explanation for this change. The modification of the ground floor created two clusters of small rooms: of (j), (k), and (l), and of (o), (n), (p), (q) (t), and (s). These rooms were accessible from area (i) of the courtyard, the pastas, and could have operated independently from the rest of the house, as stores, workshops, and spaces for some other commercial activity or rooms to be rented out.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref82" href="#endnote82">82</a></sup><span > As in the case of House IC, the rooms that were originally laid out as typical <i>oeci maiores</i>, serving as reception rooms, were turned into service areas in the second phase. A comparison with the Maison des Sceaux (GD 59D) in the Quartier de Skardhana (the other newer neighborhood on Delos), whose destruction by fire has preserved evidence for the use of its rooms, is instructive.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref83" href="#endnote83">83</a></sup><span > The Maison des Sceaux was also modified in a similar way in a later phase of the house (fig. 7). The east part of the ground floor was separated and small rooms were created to accommodate a store and workshop for grain, wine, and maybe olive oil production, which was accessible almost independently from the main entrance of the house.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref84" href="#endnote84">84</a></sup> At the west part of the ground floor the traditional <i>oecus maior</i> of the house, room (<span>μ), was connected with room (ι΄) of the adjacent Maison de l’Epée, thus extending the area of the house. In the new arangment adjacent rooms </span>(<span>ξ</span>) and  <span>(ι΄) were accessible only through </span>room (<span>μ)</span>, that was in turn accessible from the courtyard through pastas (<span>θ΄</span>). This individual cluster of rooms could have been rented out to a business.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref85" href="#endnote85">85</a></sup> The large number of pottery and twenty amphoras found in room (λ), to the east of pastas (θ΄), as well as the large piece of furniture found along the east wall of its adjacent to the south room (κ) suggest that these two rooms were used as storage spaces.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref86" href="#endnote86">86</a></sup><span > This storage could have served the activities of the adjacent cluster of rooms (μ-ξ-ι΄), of the store and workshop at the east part of the house (π-ρ-σ-τ-υ) or of the inhabitants of the upper floor of the house. The presence of a personal archive of 16,000 seals (128/7 BCE – 69 BCE), a large number of whom bore names of the Italian families known to have been active on Delos, as well as the over-lifesize “veristic” portrait busts (Inv. nos. A7258, A7259) that came from the upper floor suggest that the owner(s) were Italian bankers/traders.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref87" href="#endnote87">87</a></sup></p>
  </div>
<p id="p46" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p46">Similarly to the Maison des Sceaux, the modifications conducted at a later phase in Houses ID, as well as in House IC, created groups of rooms that could operate independently as workshops, businesses, storage places or sleeping rooms, and presumably could be rented out for such functions. The archaeological identification of such uses that the case of the Maison des Sceaux provides points to the information we lack in other Delian houses, where no fire destruction has preserved such material remains. The analysis of the architectural design of the houses allows us, however, to identify an architectural pattern in relation to these uses. We notice that in a subsequent phase some rooms of the ground floor, either intact or broken down to smaller rooms were grouped together and were made accessible through one and only entrance. In the Quartier du Stade, aside from Houses IC and ID, House IE features a similar distribution in its ground floor. The southern part of ​​the ground floor of the house has a number of rooms that were accessible from the courtyard (d) and two of them were used as storage rooms (rooms [c] and [j]).</p>

I will draw examples from two more houses in the Quartier de Skardhana, the Maison des Tritons and the Maison des Comédiens (fig. 8), to show the variety of architectural schemes that were used in order to accommodate the owner’s need for extra space.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref88" href="#endnote88">88</a></sup><span style='font-size:10.0pt; line-height:200%'> </span><span >In these two houses small rooms were subsequently added outside the original plan of the houses, taking over part of the street, in order to create spaces for service, storage as well as workshops.

Each case is different and it seems that the available space was shaped in order to serve the individual needs of the owners.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref94" href="#endnote94">94</a></sup><span > In the case of Delos, either the original larger rooms of the ground floor, the typical <i>oeci maiores </i>and <i>oeci minores</i> that Chamonard identified in the houses of the older neighborhood, the Quartier du Théâtre,</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref95" href="#endnote95">95</a></sup><span > were subsequently broken down to form smaller rooms  (e.g., House ID, Maison des Sceaux); or when this was not desirable, extra small rooms were subsequently added to the houses, which sometimes occupied parts of the street (e.g., Maison des Tritons, Maison des Comédiens). In both cases owners aimed to create small spaces that could operate as storage or workshop rooms and could have also been rented out. In other cases, remote, not-well lit and/or ventilated areas of the houses were grouped probably in order to serve for such functions (e.g., House IC).  </span></p>

<p id="p51" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p51"><span >It is possible that the storage spaces within the houses did not only serve the needs of the household but also complemented the storage needs of the commerce of Delos.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref96" href="#endnote96">96</a></sup><span > A recent study of the shops in the Quartier du Théâtre has shown how the interior shapes of the shops were in a subsequent phase furnished with shelves and mezzanines in order to accommodate the need for more storage.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref97" href="#endnote97">97</a></sup><span > It is possible that changes in the spatial arrangements of the houses discussed here were conducted in order to complement the needs of the burgeoning Delian commerce. The case of the Maison des Sceaux provides a concrete example for the integration of commercial activities within the domestic sphere, to which the Maison des Tritons and the Maison des Comédiens provide further parallels. The typological similarity of Houses IC and ID in the Quartier du Stade to the houses of the Quartier de Skardhana suggests that in the case of the houses of the Quartier du Stade as well owners created the new spatial arrangements in order to make profit in the dynamic economic microclimate of late Hellenistic Delos.</span></p>

<h2>Houses IC and ID in the context of the Quartier du Stade</h2>

<figure id="figure09" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p52"><img id="p52" alt="" width="600" src="images/figure09.png" /><figcaption id="p53" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p53">Fig. 9. Insulae I and II of the Quartier du Stade, earlier phase, plan (after Plassart 1916, pl. 1).</figcaption></figure>


<p id="p54" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p54">The development of Houses IC and ID, analyzed here, needs to be situated in the overall context of the two <i>Insulae</i> and their development. In an earlier phase of the neighborhood, <i>Rue Transversale</i> – the street in between <i>Insula</i> I and <i>Insula</i> II – was a private street that gave access to Houses IC, ID as well as IIA as the entering point to <i>Rue Transversale</i> from <i>Rue du Stade</i> operated as a doorway to a private street (fig. 9).<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref98" href="#endnote98">98</a></sup><span > Although House IIA was not investigated during the last two fieldwork seasons, Plassart’s study indicates that there were originally two openings on the north wall of courtyard (d) opening onto <i>Rue Transversale</i> that were later closed. Several small private streets are noted in the Quartier du Théâtre and the Quartier de Skardhana.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref99" href="#endnote99">99</a></sup> It seems that a change, either of ownership or of the nature of the uses, led to this street being no longer a dedicated private point of access. It is possible that the move of the entrance to House IC from room (e) to room (a), as well as the entrance to House IIA from courtyard (d) to room (a) were associated with this change.</p>

<p id="p55" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p55"><span >Furthermore, the street in between House IB and House IE was closed only in the third phase of House IB, that is, end of second - beginning of the first century BCE, when IB was turned into a perfumery.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref100" href="#endnote100">100</a></sup><span > This street was one of the streets providing access to the sea to the east side of the neighborhood and its closing may be associated with the change of the <i>Rue Transversale</i> from private to public in order to facilitate the circulation towards the shore and the port facilities that might have existed there. If this is so, the change of the nature of <i>Rue Transversale</i> from public to private, and the second construction phase of Houses IC and ID with the associated provisions for storage as well as small slave quarters, can be dated to the same period, the beginning of the first century BCE. The association of these changes points to the ways in which the growing manufacturing and commercial activities of Delos at this time – for example, the conversion of House IB to a perfume workshop – affected the development of the city. </span></p>

<p id="p56" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p56">The changes in the layout of Houses IC and ID and the creation of the perfume workshop IB, as well as the changes in the street arrangement of the Quartier du Stade addressed here, may be further related to the building project of the Xyston and the Gymnasion at the end of the second century BCE and beginning of the first century BCE. The large window on the west wall of House IC provided a view into the newly refurbished Stadion. The refurbishment of the Stadion at the end of the second century BCE would have certainly incited the redevelopment of this area at the beginning of the first century BCE. This points to another major force shaping the ancient city of Delos, that of benefaction. Both religious and civic benefactions were means of self-representation and promotion and ignited the development of the sanctuary and city of Delos from early on.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref101" href="#endnote101">101</a></sup> These benefactions in Delos during the late Hellenistic period must be understood in the context of competing claims over the growing importance of the international commerce of Delos.</p>

<p id="p57" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p57">As Delos was a passage of trade, the storage facilities in the island point to one of the factors affecting the urban growth of the island. We already noted that the new neighborhoods were formed in relation to small natural port facilities, in order to assist the load of the major big port. The capacity of these small port facilities was significantly smaller and accommodated smaller boats.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref102" href="#endnote102">102</a></sup> We may speculate that in the case of these smaller port facilities, the smaller in size and lighter in weight goods were traded, such as perfumes, unguents, incense, gems and dyes.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref103" href="#endnote103">103</a></sup> Indeed the manufacturing facilities for dye and perfume have been identified only in these new neighborhoods, for example the perfumery at the Quartier du Stade and the purple dye installations at Quartier du Skardhana and the Quartier du Stade.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref104" href="#endnote104">104</a></sup> Such products did not need the large storage facilities that we encounter to the south of the main port, but smaller facilities that could have been created within the residential units. The study of the storage facilities in the old neighborhood of the Theatre (Quartier du Théâtre) has shown that by contrast to the large storage facilities around the port, the storage facilities further up the hill, in the neighborhood of the Theatre, were of smaller scale inside the boutiques and next to manufacturing installations, while some provisions were made inside the houses.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref105" href="#endnote105">105</a></sup><span > In both new neighborhoods, the Quartier de Skardhana and the Quartier du Stade, there are no big storage facilities next to the port and the small storage facilities must have been integrated within the urban fabric, inside the residences (e.g., rooms k and l in House ID) as well as next to the manufacturing installations (e.g., perfumery IIB). The provision for storage within the neighborhood must have responded to the needs of the commercial activities of Delos and in close relation to the activities of the ports.</span></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p id="p58" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p58">This preliminary study of Houses IC and ID in relation to the overall development of the Quartier du Stade allows us to identify two driving forces behind the development of the area: on the hand, the provision of spaces that accommodated and complemented the commercial activities of the port – which were smaller in capacity and satisfied a different kind of commerce than that of the main port – and on the other, private initiatives that financed the public constructions shaping the city of Delos. Furthermore, the hastiness in construction attested in the construction techniques of the neighborhood, such as mud brick walls, suggests that changes were implemented reactively in order to fit the needs of the inhabitants and their commercial activities, which were not planned in advance.</p>

<p id="p59" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p59">The rapid urbanization of Delos may be compared with far more accelerated developments of growing commercial centers of Asia, such as Hong Kong, and the private initiatives and public benefactions igniting development in the city may be also seen in relation to such initiatives today: for example, the Burj Dubai, now Burj Khalifa, which aims to receive international recognition and attract investment to the city. I do not wish to stretch this comparison far but merely point out that we are just beginning to understand such urban developments. Urban studies today recognize what may be termed a disciplinary paralysis to sufficiently describe, let alone influence, the accelerated urbanization in developing regions of the world and the rapid redevelopment in existing urban areas. For this reason urban studies today examine the evolving agents, relationships and consequences of contemporary urbanization.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref106" href="#endnote106">106</a></sup></p>

<p id="p60" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p60">We tend to examine the large scale urban planning as applied on virgin terrain and the ways in urban planning initiatives matched the existing organic growth of cities. We identify the ancient city on the basis of key ingredients – aside from city walls and cemetery boundaries in the Hellenistic period these are: gymnastic edifices, theatre, agorai and monumental sanctuaries.<sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref107" href="#endnote107">107</a></sup><span > The example of Delos is indeed unique in that it is a city with no walls to mark its boundaries or gates and tombs pointing its entrance. The sea is the boundary and the port facilities are the gates to the city of Delos. In Delos we see Purcell’s notion of the coastline, the <i>ora maritima</i>, as a concept of organization of human resources rather than a simple geographical term.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref108" href="#endnote108">108</a></sup> <span >Aside from this particularity, Delos has the ingredients, the key structures, of a Hellenistic city. But in its particularity, the rapid urban development of Delos in the late Hellenistic period points to the interior workings of the city, its small-scale developments vis-à-vis the large scale forces that shaped the city – in this case economic activities and benefactions. The unique character of Delos brings to our attention the ties between economic and urban growth – a relation that is not unique to Delos, but merely exaggerated. In the late Hellenistic period Delos became a “merchant city,” to adopt the term of Max Weber – a city maintained by its commerce, whose organization and form were indeed shaped vis-à-vis handling and shipping activities.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref109" href="#endnote109">109</a></sup></p>
  
<p id="p61" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p61">In this preliminary sketch of my study of Delos I have tried to outline the factors that influenced the growth of Delos in the late Hellenistic period and relate them to the construction history of the Quartier du Stade. Nothing could have predicted this enormous expansion of Delos in this period – neither the fame of the sanctuary, nor the quality of the port, nor the commercial activity on the island during the period of Independence nor the geographical position of Delos. Delos does not occupy a better or more central position in relation to the neighboring islands of the Cyclades. The decision of Rome to grant the island the status of a free port combined with the destruction of Corinth, a powerful rival, in 146 BCE, as well as the intensification of the relation of Rome and Pergamon for which Delos played an intermediary role, led to the commercial and urban development of Delos.</p>

<p id="p62" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p62"><span >In effect, the settlement that we now see dates from this period. The urbanization of the island was rapid and took place during roughly 70-80 years, in the manner of what we call today a boomtown. This period is abruptly stopped after the sacks of 88 and 69 CE. As a typical boomtown the city becomes a ghost town when it ceases to be an economic center – although there is some attested occupation, especially in the areas of the sanctuary and its immediate surrounding structures in the imperial period. Delos never again gained a major importance as a religious center, and after a small prosperity of the island during the palaeochristian period, the island is abandoned at the end of the sixth century CE.</span><sup><a class="endnoteref" id="endnoteref110" href="#endnote110">110</a></sup></p>

The catastrophic events occurring in Syria, Palestine and Cilicia,

Tréheux (1992) gives 68 ethnics from Antioch, 64 from Berytos, 2 from
Laodicea in Phoenicia, 47 from Alexandria, 35 from Laodicea in Syria, 32 from
Hieropolis, 31 from Tyre, 23 from Sidon, 16 from Ascalon and 12 from Salamis.
These groups organized themselves religiously as well as ethnically according
to the worship of the gods of their homelands; for example: the merchants from
Tyre formed themselves into the Herakliastai of Tyre (i.e. the worshipers of
Tyrian Melkart): <i>ID</i>.1519. The merchants from Berytos comprised the

The Roman-Italian religious associations – the <i>collegia</i> of the
Hermaistai, Apolloniastai, Poseidoniastai and Compitaliastai –represented the
largest ethnic contingent of the island. Their importance can be gauged by the
large number of Roman-Italian families recorded in each of them. Rauh 1993, 30, Table II: ‘Roman and Italian families producing <i>homines
collegiorum</i> at Delos in the pre-Sullan era (Before 81 BCE)’. Roman, Latin, Etruscan, Campanian, Apulian, and
Samnite <i>gentilicia</i> are attested in this list, as are Greek families from
towns such as Heraclea, Neapolis and Tarentum. The majority of the Romaioi on
Delos were slaves and freedmen. Given that the Romans worked through
patronage, it should come as no surprise that estimates based on
onomastics demonstrate that the majority of the <i>Romaioi</i> recorded at
Delos were themselves slaves and freedmen of Hellenistic Greek and
Syro-Phoenician origin who worked at Delos for Roman-Italian patron families and
bore their nomenclature. Hatzfeld estimated that of 231 <i>Romaioi </i>recorded
on the island, 88 were freeborn, 95 were <i>liberti</i>, and 48 were slaves.
Rauh’s survey in 1993 of inscriptions published since 1919 contains an
additional 300 <i>Romaioi</i> whose names can be split, in similar proportions
to those found by Hatzfeld, between freeborn (118 or 40%) and slave-born
(freedmen and slaves combined, 182 or 60%). Rauh 1993, 30-32.

<p class="endnote" id="endnote60"><sup><a class="endnoteref_link" href="#endnoteref60">60</a></sup> Plassart initially assigned Greek letters to the
rooms that he excavated in House IC and numbers to Houses ID, IE and shop ε
(written in graphite pencil on his plan: <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Archives
de l’ÉfA, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>2-C DEL 119, page 6). He then
grouped these rooms as parts of houses and the shop (indicated by the red
divisions he drew on the maps) that he numbered I through VII (indicated in
blue pencil), and he assigned Latin letters to the rooms (indicated with blue
pencil as well). Plassart indicates that the figurine comes from “salle ι”
(written in graphite pencil) in his entry on July 19, 1912 (</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Archives de l’ÉfA, </span>2-C
DEL 119, page 46), which follow the entries of “Maison III” indicated in blue
on the opposite page of his notebook (verso, unnumbered). “Maison III” is House
IC on the plan on page 6 in the same notebook. On this plan, room “ι” is the
room that he later assigned as room h in blue pencil, and named the house
“Maison III” in blue pencil again. It is clear from the plan that “Maison III”
is House IC.

She suggests that the operation of the purple dye workshop would have taken place after 88 BCE when the neighborhood was abandoned. There is no evidence to confirm whether the workshop operated before or after 88 BCE. However, why would one choose such a tight corner and not a larger space or even the courtyard of the house, which would presumably have been available as well after 88 BCE (if we assume that the house was abandoned at this time), for the purple dye workshop?</p>
