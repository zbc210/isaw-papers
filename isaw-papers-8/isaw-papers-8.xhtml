<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p id="p1" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p1">The texts on the Papyrus Vindobonensis G 40822,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a> now widely known as the “Muziris papyrus,” will be remembered as among the most significant pieces of evidence related to Indo-Roman trade published in the twentieth century, and the more we understand them, the more important they become. The extant portion of the text on the verso contains the monetary evaluation of three-quarters of the South Indian cargo loaded on the ship <i>Hermapollon</i> (probably at <span class="reference" rel="dcterms:references" typeof="http://purl.org/dc/terms/Location"><a rel="rdfs:isDefinedBy" href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/50146" property="rdfs:label">Muziris</a></span>, mentioned in the text on the recto), and two recent papers, one by Federico Morelli and the other by me, have proposed an almost complete reconstruction of the evaluated commodities. Both papers emphasized, albeit in very different measures, the predominant share of pepper and <i>malabathron</i> in the cargo, the two main exports from the Limyrike emporia.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2"><sup>2</sup></a> Both Morelli and I came to recognize that the 771 money talents and 4,632 <i>drachmae</i> recorded at col. i, ll. 25-26<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3"><sup>3</sup></a> are the value of (almost) three-quarters of the pepper cargo, but while Morelli suggests that that value resulted from a price of 24 <i>drachmae</i> per <i>mina</i>, I contend that a price of 6 <i>drachmae</i> per <i>mina</i> is the only price that can account for the position of other numerical values in the text. Moreover, both Morelli and I interpret the weight number at col. i, l. 18 as the weight of three-quarters of the <i>malabathron</i> cargo, but while he reads the first two digits as 1,200 and assumes a price of 20 <i>drachmae</i> per <i>mina</i>, I read them as 1,800 and deduce a price of 12 <i>drachmae</i> per <i>mina</i>. Finally, I assume that the <i>Hermapollon</i>’s cargo included another commodity, evaluated at col. i, ll. 14-16, which might have been tortoise shell. In this paper I would like to focus on two other commodities exported on the <i>Hermapollon</i>: the “sound” ivory tusks and the <i>schidai</i>. As the meaning of the Greek term <i>schidai</i> in the papyrus is disputed, it makes better sense to analyze the two commodities in reverse order of their appearance in the document. Therefore, we shall start with the <i>schidai</i> and later consider the “sound” ivory.</p>
</section>

<section id="section2">
<h2><i>Schidai</i>, ivory of lower value.</h2>

<p id="p2" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p2">As we shall see, <i>schidai</i> represent less than 1% of the entire value of the <i>Hermapollon</i>’s cargo, and their weight was little more than half a ton. Yet a correct understanding of this entry will have a significant impact on the general interpretation of the text, and may shed some light both on the Cēra kingdom to which the ancient Muziris belonged and on the ivory trade on the ancient Indian Ocean.</p>

<p id="p3" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p3">In the papyrological documents, the Greek term σχίδαι (<i>schidai</i>) occurs only on the verso of the Muziris papyrus col. ii, ll. 16 and 25. In that portion of the text—col. ii, ll. 16-25—the value of three-quarters of the <i>schidai</i> brought back by the <i>Hermapollon</i> is calculated. The evaluation follows the complex pattern by which the three-quarters of “sound” ivory is assessed at col. ii, ll. 4-15. From the weight number representing the three-quarters (13 weight talents and 9.75 <i>minae</i>), a small parcel (22.75 <i>minae</i>), which is said to be “taken in addition by the arabarchs<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-4" href="#footnote-4"><sup>4</sup></a> for the <i>tetartologia</i>,” is removed. The rest (12 weight talents and 47 <i>minae</i>) is converted twice, first into Roman pounds at the ratio of 1 Egyptian talent to 95 Roman pounds, and then back into Egyptian talents at the ratio of 97.5 Roman pounds : 1 Egyptian talent. The resulting weight number (12 weight talents and 27 <i>minae</i>), at the price of 70 <i>drachmae</i> per <i>mina</i>, leads to a value of 8 money talents and 4,290 <i>drachmae</i>. Then the 22.75 <i>minae</i> that had been “taken in addition by the arabarchs for the <i>tetartologia</i>” are multiplied for the same price of 70 <i>drachmae</i> per <i>mina</i>: the result is 1,592.5 <i>drachmae</i>. By adding the two subtotals, a value of 8 money talents and 5,882.5 <i>drachmae</i> is obtained.</p>

</figure>

<p id="p4" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p4">As Rathbone first understood and Morelli now confirms, 13 weight talents and 9.75 <i>minae</i> are just three-quarters of the <i>schidai</i> exported on the <i>Hermapollon</i>. The entire quantity was the weight number recorded at col. i, l. 10, that is, 17 weight talents and 33 <i>minae</i>, from which one quarter (4 weight talents and 23.25 <i>minae</i>) was removed.</p>

<p id="p5" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p5">Since the talent referred to here is equivalent to 95 Roman pounds, the <i>schidai</i> weighed around 538.5 kgs. But what exactly is a <i>schida</i>? Drawing on Hesychius’ entry &lt;σχίδα&gt;· σχίδος σινδόνος, πῆγμα (<i>schida</i>: division of a garment, fabric),<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-5" href="#footnote-5"><sup>5</sup></a> Harrauer and Sijpesteijn, the first editors of the papyrus, understood the term as referring to “a detached piece of a larger whole σινδών, a bale of cloth.”<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-6" href="#footnote-6"><sup>6</sup></a> Although neither σχίδαι nor σινδόνες (cloths, garments) are mentioned in the <i>Periplus Maris Erythraei</i> as Limyrike commodities,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-7" href="#footnote-7"><sup>7</sup></a> Harrauer and Sijpesteijn pointed out that the <i>Periplus Maris Erythraei</i> does mention σινδόνες among the exports from the Ganges emporion,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-8" href="#footnote-8"><sup>8</sup></a> and that Gangetic nard, another typical Ganges commodity<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-9" href="#footnote-9"><sup>9</sup></a> imported by the <i>Hermapollon</i>,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-10" href="#footnote-10"><sup>10</sup></a> also appears among the commodities available in the Limyrike emporia.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-11" href="#footnote-11"><sup>11</sup></a> The implicit suggestion was that both Gangetic nard and “excellent Gangetic garments” were exported from the Ganges emporion to Muziris and from there re-exported to Egypt.</p>

<p id="p6" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p6">Harrauer and Sijpesteijn considered the possibility that in P.Vindob. G 40822 verso col. ii, ll. 16; 25 σχιδῶν could be a misspelling for σχιζῶν,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-12" href="#footnote-12"><sup>12</sup></a> but they rejected the idea that it could have meant “Holzscheit.”<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-13" href="#footnote-13"><sup>13</sup></a> They also rejected a connection with Hesychius’ lemma σχίδια· ὠμόλινα, on the grounds that “raw Flax” (ὠμόλινα), a typical Egyptian product, is unlikely to appear among the imports from India.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-14" href="#footnote-14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p id="p7" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p7">The interpretations of Harrauer and Sijpesteijn, basically accepted or unquestioned by subsequent scholars,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-15" href="#footnote-15"><sup>15</sup></a> were challenged by Rathbone. Considering σχίδα as only a variant of σχίζα (piece of wood cut off, lath, splinter), Rathbone suggested that the <i>schidai</i> were fragments of elephant tusks and thus distinct from the “sound ivory” (ἐλέφας ὑγιής) mentioned at col. ii, l. 4 of the same text, which were entire tusks.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-16" href="#footnote-16"><sup>16</sup></a> Rathbone buttressed his interpretation observing 1) that the μέν at col. ii, l. 4 and a δέ to be read at col. ii, l. 16<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-17" href="#footnote-17"><sup>17</sup></a> structured the phrase so as to contrast the sound ivory and the <i>schidai</i>;<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-18" href="#footnote-18"><sup>18</sup></a> and 2) that the value of the unspecified ivory (ἐλέφας), lost with the lacuna at col. ii, l. 26, must have merged the value of the sound ivory with that of the <i>schidai</i>. To me, Rathbone’s argument seems decisive on this point: if <i>schidai</i> were not ivory, the μέν at col. ii, l. 4, would be a strange μέν <i>solitarium</i>; and if <i>schidai</i> were not ivory, then we could not explain—except as a clerical error—why the clerk records again the value of an unspecified ivory, after having already calculated the value of the <i>schidai</i>. Reasonable as it seemed at the time, the interpretation of the first editors does not accord as well with the context as does Rathbone’s reading.</p>
</section>

<section id="section3">
<h2>Fragments or imperfect tusks?</h2>

<p id="p8" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p8">That said, the sense of the contrast between sound ivory and <i>schidai</i> still remains to be properly understood. The difference of price between sound ivory (100 <i>drachmae</i> per <i>mina</i>) and <i>schidai</i> (70 <i>drachmae </i>per <i>mina</i>) makes it clear that <i>schidai</i> were ivory of secondary quality. However, was their quality secondary because they were “accidental fragments rather than sawn pieces” of ivory, as Rathbone assumed? The question is far from trifling, not least because it is pivotal for determining the nature of the arabarchs’ share.</p>

<p id="p9" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p9">According to Rathbone, the evaluation preserved in the papyrus concerns only three-quarters of the <i>Hermapollon’</i>s cargo because one-quarter of the commodities would have been removed to pay the quarter-tax in kind. Consistently, the rationale of the share “taken in addition by the arabarchs for the quarter-tax” is seen as a way to simplify the practical division of sound ivory and <i>schidai, </i>two commodities from which an exact weight was not easy to extract.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-19" href="#footnote-19"><sup>19</sup></a> In other words, since it was impossible for the arabarchs to take exactly 25% of the ivory weights without sawing the tusks or the fragments (and thereby damaging the commodity), they took a little more than 25%: 11.75 <i>minae</i> (around 6 kgs), in the case of sound ivory; as much as 22.75 <i>minae</i> (around 11.6 kgs), in the case of the <i>schidai</i>.</p>

<p id="p10" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p10">The contradiction inherent in Rathbone’s argument was understood by Morelli, who follows Rathbone in assuming that the quarter-tax was paid in kind and that the function of the shares taken in addition by the arabarchs was to ease the payment in kind of the quarter-tax of commodities such as ivory tusks and <i>schidai</i>.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-20" href="#footnote-20"><sup>20</sup></a> Precisely for that reason, however, Morelli is reluctant to accept Rathbone’s conclusion that <i>schidai</i> were accidental fragments of tusks. His implicit reasoning is clear: if the 22.75 <i>minae</i> (= 11.6 kgs) taken in addition by the arabarchs are only a fraction of the weight of the smallest <i>schida </i>of the lot<i>,</i> the Greek term cannot refer to tusk fragments, but must refer rather to entire tusks that were imperfect in some way—spoiled or cracked or only slightly broken. In other words, the <i>schidai</i> were in fact whole tusks, but not sound.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-21" href="#footnote-21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p id="p11" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p11">There is very little doubt that the entry of sound ivory (ἐλέφας ὑγιής) refers to entire tusks: at col. ii, ll. 12 and 13 the same commodity is mentioned as <span xml:lang="grc">ὀδόντες</span>, “teeth,” and at col. i, l. 5 the figure 167 must be precisely the number of the tusks, as Morelli recognized.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-22" href="#footnote-22"><sup>22</sup></a> It is equally unquestionable that the adjective “sound” (ὑγιής) implies an assessment of the quality of the tusks, determining which tusk is sound and which is not.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-23" href="#footnote-23"><sup>23</sup></a> Nonetheless, the assumption that just two terms, sound ivory and <i>schidai, </i>could cover the entire spectrum of possible ivory classifications is unwarranted, and the fact that in this document sound ivory and <i>schidai</i> are opposed to each other does not guarantee that any tusk deemed not sound is by default a <i>schida</i>, or that a <i>schida</i>, as such, cannot be sound. In my view, the undeniable connection of σχίδα with the verb σχίζω (split, divide, cut out, tear) and the parallelism with σχίζα and σχίδαξ (piece of wood cut off) strongly favor Rathbone’s translation as “fragments.”<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-24" href="#footnote-24"><sup>24</sup></a> The fact that the arabarchs “took in addition” as much as 22.75 <i>minae</i> should not bias our understanding of the Greek term. Nor should we assume that those fragments were necessarily unsound or accidental. Indeed, many of them were made on purpose and taken from perfectly sound tusks.</p>

<p id="p12" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p12">The <i>schidai</i> of the Muziris papyrus can hardly be identified with what elsewhere is called περιπρίσματα or παραπρίσματα,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-25" href="#footnote-25"><sup>25</sup></a> namely, waste from the ivory carvers’ shops: the difference between the price of the tusks (100 <i>drachmae</i> per <i>mina</i>) and that of the <i>schidai</i> (70 <i>drachmae</i> per <i>mina</i>) is too small to address the gap in value between entire tusks and small scraps.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-26" href="#footnote-26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p id="p13" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p13">In order to justify his translation of the term <i>schidai</i>, Rathbone recalled a passage by <span class="reference" rel="dcterms:references" typeof="lawd:Person"><a rel="rdfs:isDefinedBy" href="http://catalog.perseus.org/catalog/urn:cite:perseus:author.1141" property="rdfs:label">Pliny the Elder</a></span>, in which the elephants are said to deliberately break their tusks in order to escape from hunters: ‘They themselves [sc. the elephants] know that the only thing in them that makes desirable plunder is in their weapons […] and when surrounded by a party of hunters they post those with the smallest tusks in front, so that it may be thought not worth while to fight them, and afterwards when exhausted they break their tusks by dashing them against a tree, and ransom themselves at the price of the desired booty’ (transl. by H. Rackham).<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-27" href="#footnote-27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p id="p14" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p14">This passage requires two clarifications. The first is that it is part of a section comprising several other <i>mirabilia</i> testifying to the quasi-human affective and cognitive capacities of the elephant<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-28" href="#footnote-28"><sup>28</sup></a>—a rather popular topic in Western classical literature.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-29" href="#footnote-29"><sup>29</sup></a> The second is that it attributes to elephants a tactic comparable to that ascribed to beavers, when they are chased down by hunters. Just like elephants, beavers ‘ransom themselves with that part of their body on account of which they are chiefly sought for.’<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-30" href="#footnote-30"><sup>30</sup></a> Whatever the truth behind it, we do not need to rely on this tale to explain the ivory fragments exported from Muziris. As a matter of fact, another more prosaic explanation is at hand. I propose, in fact, to identify the <i>schidai</i> as those fragments that are regularly trimmed from the tusks of captive elephants.</p>

<p id="p15" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p15">Tusk trimming is a standard practice in Kerala today,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-31" href="#footnote-31"><sup>31</sup></a> but it was also common in ancient India, as is shown in some Sanskrit classical texts. Regular trimming of elephant tusks is mentioned in the <i>Arthaśāstra</i>, in the lines that end the section dedicated to the duties of the <i>hastyadhyakṣa</i>, the “superintendent of the elephants”:</p>

<blockquote><i>danta-mūla-parīṇāha-dvi-guṇaṃ projjhya kalpayet /abde dvy-ardhe nadī-jānāṃ pañca-abde parvata-okasām</i>//</blockquote>

<blockquote>Leaving the double length of the circumference of the tusk at the root, he should cut [sc. the rest], every two years and a half in the case of those [sc. elephants] from river-banks, every five years in the case of those from mountainous regions.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-32" href="#footnote-32"><sup>32</sup></a></blockquote>

<p id="p16" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p16">Approximately the same rules are mentioned in Varāhamihira’s <i>Bṛhat Saṃhitā</i>:</p>

<blockquote><i>dantasya mūlaparidhiṃ dvirāyataṃ prohya kalpayeccheṣam/ adhikamanūpacarāṇāṃ nyūnaṃ giricāriṇāṃ kiñcit//</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>Having left the double length of the circumference of the tooth at its root, cut the rest; more (often) in those elephants that live in the humid places, a little less often in those that live in the mountain.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-33" href="#footnote-33"><sup>33</sup></a></blockquote>

<p id="p17" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p17">If we turn to Greek authors, the sawing of Indian elephant tusks is also referenced, although only as a practice limited to the few war elephants with unusually big tusks, by <span class="reference" rel="dcterms:reference" typeof="lawd:Person"><a rel="rdfs:isDefinedBy" href="http://catalog.perseus.org/catalog/urn:cite:perseus:author.413" property="rdfs:label">Cosmas Indicopleustes</a></span>:</p>

<blockquote>ὀδόντας δὲ μεγάλους οἱ ἰνδικοὶ οὐκ ἔχουσιν, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐὰν σχῶσι, πρίζουσιν αὐτοὺς διὰ τὸ βάρος, ἵνα μὴ βαρῇ αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Indian elephants are not provided with large tusks, but should they have such, they saw them off, that their weight may not encumber them in war.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-34" href="#footnote-34"><sup>34</sup></a></blockquote>

<p id="p18" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p18">The practice of leaving ‘the double length of the circumference of the tooth at its roots’ addresses the need to avoid cutting into the living pulp of the tusk.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-35" href="#footnote-35"><sup>35</sup></a> The fact that elephants living in the mountains may get their tusks trimmed less often than those living by the riverbanks has been taken as a proof of a slower growth rate of tusks of the mountain elephants.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-36" href="#footnote-36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<h2><i>Schidai</i> and the arabarchs’ share</h2>

<p id="p19" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p19">If the above interpretation of the term σχίδα is correct, then there are consequences to be drawn related to the fiscal procedures implied in the Muziris papyrus. If the <i>schidai</i> mentioned in the text do refer to the remnants of ivory regularly trimmed away from tusks either every two and a half or every five years, then it follows that a <i>schida</i> normally weighed much less than an entire tusk, since the trimming has to leave ‘the double length of the circumference of the tooth at its roots.’ Therefore, the 22.75 <i>minae</i> (around 11.6 kgs) of <i>schidai</i> taken in addition by the arabarchs, far from being only a fraction of a <i>schida</i>, will equal several <i>schidai</i>. In conclusion, whatever was “taken in addition” was not randomly seized because it was impossible to do otherwise, but must have been rationally determined and deliberately “taken.”</p>

<p id="p20" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p20">As a matter of fact, it seems that the shares of sound ivory and <i>schidai</i> taken by the arabarchs were arithmetically defined. The quota of sound ivory (11.75 <i>minae</i>) results from charging 1 <i>mina</i> for every 10 weight talents (1/600, ἑξακοσιοστή) of the total amount (105 weight talents and 13 <i>minae</i>, rounded up to 110 weight talents), plus the fraction of <i>mina</i> of the three-quarters (.75). Similarly, the quota of the σχίδαι (22.75 <i>minae</i>) results from charging 120 <i>drachmae</i> for every weight talent (1/50, πεντηκοστή) of the total amount (17 weight talents and 33 <i>minae</i>, rounded up to 18 weight talents, which makes 21.6 <i>minae</i>, rounded up to 22), plus the fraction of <i>mina</i> of the three-quarters (.75). If this explanation is correct, it follows that the share taken in addition by the arabarchs was nothing but a surcharge. Therefore, either the tax collector was able to levy in kind a quarter-tax plus surcharge based on weight and arithmetically determined—no matter the commodity—or else the calculations of the Muziris papyrus verso imply a payment of the total dues in the form of money.</p>

<p id="p21" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p21">As mentioned, in the Muziris papyrus the <i>schidai</i> have a lower value (70 <i>drachmae</i> per <i>mina</i>) than the entire tusks of sound ivory (100 <i>drachmae</i> per <i>mina</i>).<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-37" href="#footnote-37"><sup>37</sup></a> Both <i>schidai</i> and complete tusks in turn have values considerably higher than pepper.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-38" href="#footnote-38"><sup>38</sup></a> The contrast with the Price Edict, in which ivory and pepper have maximum prices of 150 and 800 <i>denarii</i> respectively,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-39" href="#footnote-39"><sup>39</sup></a> is evident. Since the values assumed by the Muziris papyrus and the maximum prices fixed by the Price Edict are meant to remain unaffected by the short-term supply-and-demand dynamics in any particular place in the Roman empire, the overturning of the hierarchy between the values of these two commodities was not due to episodic reasons. Indeed, such a radical change is likely to have been the result of complex factors that cannot be fully explored here. Nonetheless, it may be worth pointing out that the low valuation of pepper in the Muziris papyrus is also dependent on the direct voyages to South India of ships like the <i>Hermapollon.</i> The cessation of that relatively economical pattern of trade must have contributed to the higher prices of pepper in late antiquity.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-40" href="#footnote-40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p id="p22" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p22">The contrasting dynamics of ivory values may in part be illuminated by Pliny’s claim that in his time India, where only some of the male elephants have tusks,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-41" href="#footnote-41"><sup>41</sup></a> was the major supplier of ivory.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-42" href="#footnote-42"><sup>42</sup></a> If Pliny is to be trusted, then neither the excellent Adulis ivory nor the abundant, if inferior, Rhapta ivory,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-43" href="#footnote-43"><sup>43</sup></a> nor any other East African ivory,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-44" href="#footnote-44"><sup>44</sup></a> were major Mediterranean imports in the mid-first century CE. The potential of the African continent, where both male and female elephants have tusks, was thus only marginally exploited. By late antiquity, however, the volume of African ivory exported had likely substantially increased,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-45" href="#footnote-45"><sup>45</sup></a> as suggested by the emphasis in the <i>Expositio totius mundi et gentium</i> on the countless number of elephants of <i>India minor </i>(=East Africa)<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-46" href="#footnote-46"><sup>46</sup></a> and, less ambiguously, Cosmas Indicopleustes’ remarks about the population of <i>Aithiopia</i>’s elephants and the scope of the export of their ivory.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-47" href="#footnote-47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p id="p23" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p23">One final observation may be made on this subject: Cosmas Indicopleustes also noted that the African elephants had bigger tusks than the Indian elephants.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-48" href="#footnote-48"><sup>48</sup></a> He was probably referring to African savanna elephants (<i>Loxodonta Africana Africana</i>), which tend to develop longer and thicker tusks than either the Asian elephant (<i>Elephas maximus</i>) or the even smaller African forest elephant (<i>Loxodonta Africana cyclotis</i>).<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-49" href="#footnote-49"><sup>49</sup></a> It has to be emphasized, though, that Cosmas’ information cannot be taken as an indication that, in the first centuries of the Christian era, the traded African ivory comprised tusks that were <i>on average</i> bigger than those of the traded Asian ivory. Aside from the varying growth potential of different species, the average weight of the traded tusks would have depended on the selection strategies of hunters and merchants; hence the average weight per tusk of commercial lots of Asian ivory could have been higher than that of some African commercial lots. Therefore, it is not impossible—indeed, it is arguable, as we shall see—that the maximum price for ivory in the Price Edict was also influenced by the import of large quantities of African tusks of rather low average weight.</p>

<h2><i>Schidai</i> and royal elephants</h2>

<p id="p24" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p24">While several of the commodities imported by the Roman ships from the Limyrike emporia were not home products of Malabar,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-50" href="#footnote-50"><sup>50</sup></a> the ivory exported by the <i>Hermapollon</i>, both the entire tusks and the trimmings, was most probably a regional product. The availability of ivory at Muziris was facilitated by the fact that the Cēra kings who controlled Muziris also controlled inland forests rich in wild elephants; it is not coincidental that Cēra coins—also found at the site of Pattanam, most likely included in the Muziris area<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-51" href="#footnote-51"><sup>51</sup></a>—bear an elephant on their obverse.</p>

<p id="p25" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p25">The abundance of elephants in the Cēra forests was the inspiration for the simile the poet Ku<u>nr</u>ukaṭpāliyāta<u>n</u>ār employed to address the Cēra king Cēramā<u>n</u> Karuvūrē<u>r</u>iya Oḷvāṭkōp Peruñcēral Irumpo<u>r</u>ai:</p>

<p id="p27" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p27">In ancient India, captive male elephants with big tusks<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-54" href="#footnote-54"><sup>54</sup></a> are a prerogative of the highest political authorities, and essential to their military strength. According to Megasthenes, only the king has the right to own horses and elephants,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-55" href="#footnote-55"><sup>55</sup></a> and in the <i>Arthaśāstra</i>’s words the ‘king’s victory is mainly a matter of elephants.’<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-56" href="#footnote-56"><sup>56</sup></a> In the theory laid down by the <i>Tolkāppiyam</i>, the possession of war elephants<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-57" href="#footnote-57"><sup>57</sup></a> is a distinctive feature of the <i>aracar</i>.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-58" href="#footnote-58"><sup>58</sup></a> It is likely that the term, a Tamilization of Skt. <i>rājan-</i>,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-59" href="#footnote-59"><sup>59</sup></a> is meant to be inclusive of both <i>vēntar</i>, “kings” of the highest rank, and <i>vēḷir</i>, somewhat high dignitaries or more or less dependent chieftains.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-60" href="#footnote-60"><sup>60</sup></a> At any rate, in <i>Caṅkam</i> literature many <i>vēḷir</i> are said to have (or to donate) captive elephants.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-61" href="#footnote-61"><sup>61</sup></a> On the other hand, it is reasonable to assume that the regional pre-eminence of the <i>mūvēntar</i>—the three major powers of the Cērar, Pāṇṭiyar, and Co<u>l</u>ar—was backed by the ownership of a higher number of war elephants. It will suffice here to quote a few lines in praise of the Cēra king Celvakkaṭuṅkōv Āḻiyātaṉ:</p>

<blockquote>You free the poets from poverty with the tribute that you receive from the inimical <i>maṉṉar</i>!<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-62" href="#footnote-62"><sup>62</sup></a> The many male elephants perfect in action, who with their large rugged trunks and lifting tusks were stationed near the guarded forest of the <i>vēntu</i> (kingdom of a <i>vēnta<u>n</u></i>, a ‘king’ of the highest rank), with their big necks with flower-like spots and fragrant cheeks smeared with dust, they moved dispersed here and there and destroyed the ramparts of the enemy.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-63" href="#footnote-63"><sup>63</sup></a></blockquote>

<p id="p28" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p28">The 538.5 kgs of <i>schidai</i> shipped out by the <i>Hermapollon </i>were trimmings taken from captive elephants. As the tusks had to be trimmed leaving ‘the double length of the circumference of the tusk at the root,’ a <i>schida</i> could hardly weigh more than one-third of an entire tusk. More precisely, since the tusks of the captive elephants had to be trimmed every two and a half or every five years, the average weight of the <i>schidai</i> imported by the <i>Hermapollon</i> should have been between 1 and 7 kgs.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-64" href="#footnote-64"><sup>64</sup></a> An export of 538.5 kgs of <i>schidai</i>, which must have numbered between 75 and 540 pieces,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-65" href="#footnote-65"><sup>65</sup></a> could hardly have been achieved without the contribution of the trimmings from the large elephant contingent of the Cēra king, who controlled both the most famous of the Limyrike emporia and the forests where wild elephants abounded. If the quantity exported by the <i>Hermapollon </i>did not represent an exceptional peak, but was the routine annual export from Muziris or even less than that, then the Muziris export of <i>schidai</i> had to be sustained by a population of at least 380 captive adult male elephants.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-66" href="#footnote-66"><sup>66</sup></a> This number is not far from the 500 or 600 elephants that Cosmas Indicopleustes attributes to several kings of the west coast of India—among them, the king of Male.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-67" href="#footnote-67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<h2>Tusks, hunters and bandits</h2>
<p id="p29" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p29">Aside from the tusks acquired from elephants that died in captivity, those exported from Muziris were largely from wild tuskers, killed by forest dwellers for their meat and their ivory:</p>

<blockquote>The hunter from the forest with mighty hands like iron, concealed behind a blooming Marāam tree, shoots choicest arrows, at the mighty chest of a tusker of speckled forehead, and plucks out the white tusks that with might destroy the foes; he plants them, in his hut thatched with grass […] The man from the mountain eats meat cooked on the flame of sandalwood, partying with relations, taking pleasure from toddy (transl. A. Dhakshinamurthy, with modifications).<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-68" href="#footnote-68"><sup>68</sup></a></blockquote>

<p id="p30" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p30"><i>Caṅkam</i> literature offers references to ivory trade undertaken by elephant hunters who are said to make their living by selling tusks. Quite interestingly, some of them are located in the western part of the Kolli hills, where Ōri, a minor chieftain to some extent dependent upon the Cēra kings,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-69" href="#footnote-69"><sup>69</sup></a> rules:</p>

<blockquote>[…]the western [side of] mount Kolli,/ [belonging to] Ōri with strong bow,/ where [people] eat by selling the tooth of the swift-eyed elephant/ when they are hungry in small homes (transl. E. Wilden).<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-70" href="#footnote-70"><sup>70</sup></a></blockquote>

<p id="p31" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p31">Another poem from <i>Caṅkam</i> literature records a chief of <i>Iḷaiyar</i>,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-71" href="#footnote-71"><sup>71</sup></a> who keeps an elephant tusk in his home. Left with no money because his robbery business is stagnant, he trades his white tusk to satisfy his desire for alcohol.</p>

<blockquote>[…]the chief of the strong bow and lawless life <i>Iḷaiyar</i>, who rob the trading caravan that moves along roads lined by dry bamboo, when he is exhausted by the sun, he visits the house of broad shouldered women with tattoos on their bellies where the toddy is sold. Unable to pay for it, he pats the small head of the running son and points out the white tusk of the forest elephant in musth […].<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-72" href="#footnote-72"><sup>72</sup></a></blockquote>

<p id="p32" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p32">The twofold activity of the <i>Iḷaiyar</i>—bandits at the expense of the travelling traders, as well as hunters of wild elephants in the forests—puts them on or beyond the fringe of the Cēra king’s control and protection. Nonetheless, they too fuelled Muziris’ trade.</p>

<h2>Tusk comparisons</h2>

<p id="p33" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p33">The tusks imported by the Hermapollon must have been carefully selected. They were not only “sound,” as attested by the text, they were also rather large, as their average weight shows.</p>

<p id="p34" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p34">At col. ii, l. 13, Morelli rightly rejects the editors’ reading καὶ τεταρτολογουμένων. Calling for a comparison with the 2,000 three-cubit-long tusks paraded by L. Aemilius Paulus in his triumph of 167 BCE,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-73" href="#footnote-73"><sup>73</sup></a> he ingeniously reads διπή̣χ̣ε̣ω̣ν̣ ὅ̣λων, “entire, two-cubit-long” tusks. Apart from the ending -λων, I can neither confirm Morelli’s reading nor suggest any alternative. I can however emphasize that the total weight of the tusks imported by the <i>Hermapollon </i>shows by itself that those 167 tusks were a selected lot, just as the reading διπή̣χ̣ε̣ω̣ν̣ ὅ̣λων would imply. As a matter of fact, 167 tusks weighing 105 talents and 13 <i>minae</i> (= 3,228.5 kgs) have a rather high average weight of 37.8 <i>minae</i> (= 19.332 kgs) per tusk.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-74" href="#footnote-74"><sup>74</sup></a> It is not that great a stretch from the average weight of the two tusks sold to Apollo’s temple in Delos by Herakleides of Tyre (46.3125 <i>minae</i> per tusk)<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-75" href="#footnote-75"><sup>75</sup></a> or the thirty-four tusks donated by Ptolemy Auletes to the temple of Didyma (42.94 <i>minae</i> per tusk),<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-76" href="#footnote-76"><sup>76</sup></a> especially since the talent(s) implied by these inscriptions must have been lighter than the one used by the quarter-tax administration to weigh the <i>Hermapollon</i>’s cargo.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-77" href="#footnote-77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>

<p id="p35" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p35">However, those few tusks bought by or donated to a temple were likely of exceptional quality. A commercial lot such as the <i>Hermapollon</i> cargo is thus more appropriately compared with other commercial lots. Following this perspective, documents from the early sixteenth century may provide more useful evidence:</p>

<ol>
	<li>In 1506, Pero Ferreira Fogaça, <i>capitão</i> of Kilwa takes notice of a <i>zambuco</i> carrying 570 tusks weighing 92 <i>quintaes</i>, 2 <i>arrobas</i>, 31 <i>arrates </i>(= 5,448.95 kgs): the average weight is 9.56 kgs per tusk.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-78" href="#footnote-78"><sup>78</sup></a></li>
	<li>January 18<sup>th</sup> 1507, Nuno Vaz Pereira, <i>capitão</i> of Sofala, orders delivery of 264 tusks and two pieces weighing 73 <i>quintaes</i>, 1 <i>arroba</i>, 20 <i>arates </i>(= 4,312.39 kgs): counting the two pieces as tusks, the average weight is 16.21 kgs per tusk.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-79" href="#footnote-79"><sup>79</sup></a></li>
	<li>December 20<sup>th</sup> 1514, Álvaro de Bouro reports a sale of an ivory stock in Lisbon.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-80" href="#footnote-80"><sup>80</sup></a> The document details not only the number of tusks and their total weight, but also the number of tusks contained in each of the thirteen lots of 6 <i>quintaes</i> (= 352.512 kgs), plus one lot of 4 <i>quintaes</i> and 24 <i>arrateis </i>(= 246.024 kgs) in which the stock has been divided and sold. Since the total weight of the 385 tusks was 82 <i>quintaes</i> and 24 <i>arrateis</i> (= 4,828.68 kgs)<i>, </i>the average weight per tusk was 12.542 kgs. However, the different lots have very different average weights: they range from 20.736 kgs to 4.641 kgs per tusk.</li>

<p id="p36" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p36">With the possible exception of the ivory sent to Goa by Lourenço Moreno in 1515,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-85" href="#footnote-85"><sup>85</sup></a> all of these ivory lots are of certain African origin. It is therefore clear that the distinction made between big and small tusks in some of these documents cannot correspond with the contrast between tusks and <i>schidai</i>, which characterizes the <i>Hermapollon </i>cargo, if the <i>schidai</i> are, as I suggest, captive elephant tusk trimmings.</p>

<p>In his <i>Informação para el-rei</i> written from Goa in 1530, Jordão de Freitas distinguishes between three types of ivory: 1) the good, big, sound, and clean one (<i>bom grande são e linpo</i>), whose value in Sofala was between thirty and forty <i>maticais </i>per <i>bahar</i>; 2) the “small” one (<i>pequeno</i>), whose tusks weigh between one and one-half <i>faraçola </i>(= between 11.75 and 5.87 kgs) each, and whose value was half the price of the first type; 3) the “even smaller” one (<i>mays meyudo</i>), whose value in Sofala was ten to twelve <i>maticais</i>.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-86" href="#footnote-86"><sup>86</sup></a> The small size of the second and third types in de Freitas’ categorization and the low average weight of the listed African ivory lots can hardly be explained by just assuming that all of those tusks belonged to forest elephants (<i>Loxodonta Africana cyclotis</i>). Such an assumption would be inconsistent with the present geographical distribution of that species, and it would still require one to emphasize the inattention to tusk size during the elephant hunts, since tusks lighter than 5.87 kgs must have belonged to very young animals, no matter the species. Apparently, African hunters were only marginally motivated by ivory traders or influenced by the different commercial values assigned to tusks of different size. The low average weight of those lots—all the more remarkable since the tusks must have belonged mainly to savanna elephants—shows that in Africa elephants must have been killed for reasons other than the ivory trade.</p>

<h2>The ivory of the “Elephant-eaters”</h2>
	
<p id="p37" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p37">The relatively low average weight of the sixteenth-century African tusks<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-87" href="#footnote-87"><sup>87</sup></a> suggests a clue for interpreting a remark by the author of the <i>Periplus Maris Erythraei </i>about the ivory exported from Rhapta. In this “very last emporium of Azania,” a great amount of ivory is said to be available. Its quality, however, was held to be inferior to that exported from the much closer Adulis.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-88" href="#footnote-88"><sup>88</sup></a> The composition of the sixteenth-century ivory lots from Sofala suggests that the Rhapta export was inferior to the Adulis one, not because it was from a different species or because their tusks were always less sound than the Adulis ones, but because it resulted from a different kind of trade and perhaps a differently motivated hunt. The fine Adulis ivory came from faraway regions “beyond the Nile,” it was conveyed to Axum, then to Koloe and finally to Adulis.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-89" href="#footnote-89"><sup>89</sup></a> On its way to the Red Sea, the ivory was traded by foreign merchants, who wanted to be paid in Roman money;<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-90" href="#footnote-90"><sup>90</sup></a> it was shipped to Egypt by merchants from Roman Egypt. Such a commercial circuit necessarily required a deliberate selection of tusks based on their quality, which had to be of the “Adulis standard.”<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-91" href="#footnote-91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>

<p id="p38" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p38">In contrast, the Rhapta trade had a completely different style. Ivory was imported by small Muza ships, manned by crews linked by intermarriages with the Rhapta people.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-92" href="#footnote-92"><sup>92</sup></a> Together with spears, axes, knives, awls, and glass stones, they would bring large quantities of grain and wine to be used in nearby places ‘not for trade, but because of extravagance, for the entertainment of the barbarians.’<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-93" href="#footnote-93"><sup>93</sup></a> It is therefore likely that the Rhapta ivory was “inferior” to the Adulis ivory, because it included considerable quantities of <i>pequeno</i> and <i>mays miudo marfim</i>—“small” and “even smaller” tusks. Once it arrived at Muza, the inferior but plentiful ivory from Rhapta was most likely sent to Barygaza,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-94" href="#footnote-94"><sup>94</sup></a> just as in the sixteenth century enormous amounts of ivory—Garcia da Orta quantifies them in 6,000 <i>quintais</i> (more than 350 tons) per year<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-95" href="#footnote-95"><sup>95</sup></a>—were sent to India from the East Africa coast between Sofala and Malindi.</p>

<p id="p39" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p39">As mentioned above, the very small tusks included in the ivory lots show that African elephants were not killed for their ivory alone. The Greek perception of the particular human-elephant relationship in East Africa is reflected in the term <i>Elephantophagoi<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-96" href="#footnote-96"><sup>96</sup></a></i> (“Elephant-eaters”), elaborated when the exploration of the African world south of Egypt inspired an ethnological taxonomy based on dietary habits. Along the lines of the much older <i>Ichthyophagoi</i> and of the new entry <i>Chelonophagoi</i> (re)discovered in Carmania by Alexander’s army,<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-97" href="#footnote-97"><sup>97</sup></a> <i>Rhizophagoi</i>, <i>Hylophagoi</i>, <i>Spermatophagoi</i>, <i>Akridophagoi</i>, <i>Struthophagoi</i>, <i>Agriophagoi</i>, <i>Moschophagoi</i>, and <i>Elephantophagoi</i> were identified. Greek ethnographic accounts ignored the fact that elephant meat was to some extent eaten in ancient South India as well. Moreover, the Greek writings did not take into account the idea that African societies may have killed elephants not only for their meat but also to prevent them from crop raiding: in their opinion, fondness for elephant meat was the key factor. In a story repeated by Agatharchides, the <i>Elephantophagoi</i> refused to stop killing elephants and eating their meat despite Ptolemy’s urging and the promise of splendid rewards.<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-98" href="#footnote-98"><sup>98</sup></a> They replied that they would not change their way of life, not even for all the kingdom of Egypt. The task of providing the Ptolemaic army with an Indian-style elephant division<a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-99" href="#footnote-99"><sup>99</sup></a> thus had to accommodate the cultural traditions of Africa. The story may be fictional, but the perception that in Africa the human-elephant relations were different from India was accurate: the contrast between the African ivory carried by the Portuguese ships and the Indian ivory shipped out by the <i>Hermapollon</i> supports this distinction.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-85"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-85">85</a></sup> The Portuguese quickly recognized the business opportunities proffered by the Malabar ivory. As early as 1503 Afonso de Albuquerque was said to be trafficking in ivory in Cananor: P. Pinto, <i>Índice analítico das cartas dos governadores de África na Torre do Tombo</i>, “Anais de história de além-mar” 11 (2010), p. 253 (I thank P. Pinto for this reference).—Two <i>cartas de quitacão</i> for <i>feitores</i> in Cochin mention ivory lots of unspecified origin: 111 <i>quintaes</i>, 2 <i>arrobas</i>, 12 <i>arrateis</i> mentioned in the <i>quitação</i> issued for Lourenço Moreno after his first stint as <i>feitor</i> in Cochin in the years 1506 and 1507 (ANTT Chancel. de D. Manuel I, Liv. III, f. 17<sup>r</sup>, transcribed in A. Braamcamp Freire, <i>Cartas de Quitacão del Rei D. Manuel</i>, “Archivo Histórico Portuguez” 4 (1906), p. 288) and 55 <i>quintaes</i> and 6 <i>arrobas</i> recorded in the <i>quitação</i> for André Dias, <i>feitor</i> in Cochin from the end of 1507 to 1509 (ANTT Chancel. de D. Manuel I, Liv. III, f. 46<sup>v</sup>, transcribed in A. Braamcamp Freire, <i>Cartas de Quitacão del Rei D. Manuel</i>, “Archivo Histórico Portuguez” 1 (1903), pp. 278-279). These two lots may be of either Indian or East African origin, since the shipment of African ivory from Sofala to Cochin in 1517 (DPMAC V n. 28, pp. 182-189) may be just an episode of a recurring and preexisting pattern.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-87"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-87">87</a></sup> The average weights of the lots listed here range from 9.56 to 16.21 kgs per tusks. Small tusks comprised the overwhelming majority of the huge lot (number of tusks unknown) mentioned in DPMAC VII, n. 11, p. 175: in 1547, the Sofala factory received 56 <i>bahar</i> (approximately 14,240 kgs) of ivory, 14 of which (around 3,560 kgs) were of <i>grosso </i>(“large”) and 42 (approximately 10,680 kgs) of <i>miudo </i>(“small”) kind. It may be interesting to note that in 1978 and 1980, estimates on two lots of more than 200 tons each gave average weights of 9.65 and 16.00 kgs, respectively: I. S. C. Parker/ E. B. Martin, <i>How many Elephants are Killed for the Ivory Trade?</i>, “Oryx” 16 (1982), pp. 235-239.</p>
