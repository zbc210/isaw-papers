<p class="abstract"><em>Abstract:</em><span id="abstract"> The
          Antikythera Mechanism is a mechanical astronomical instrument that was discovered in an
          ancient shipwreck at the beginning of the twentieth century, made about the second century
          B.C. It had several pointers showing the positions of the moon and sun in the zodiac, the
          approximate date according to a lunisolar calendar, several subsidiary dials showing
          calendrical phenomena, and also predictions of eclipses. The mechanism also had a display
          of the Moon’s phases: a small ball, half pale and half dark, rotating with the lunar
          synodic period and so showing the phases of the moon. The remains of the moon phase
          display include a fragmentary contrate gear. According to the reconstruction offered by
          Michael Wright, this gear is now pointing unintentionally in the wrong direction. In this
          paper we offer for the first time a detailed description of the remains of the moon phase
          mechanism. Based on this evidence, we argue that the extant contrate gear direction is the
          originally intended one, and we offer a conjectural explanation for its direction as an
          essential part of a representation of Aristarchus’s hypothesis that half moon phase is
          observably displaced from exact quadrature.</span></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="textindent0" id="p1">The Antikythera Mechanism is a mechanical astronomical
          instrument that was discovered in an <span class="reference" typeof="dcterms:Location"><a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/560230">ancient
              shipwreck</a></span> at the beginning of the twentieth century. The shipwreck has been
          dated around 60 B.C.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">1</a></sup> A consensus does not exist on the question whether the
          Mechanism was built around that time or significantly earlier.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2">2</a></sup>
          After twenty centuries under water, it is incomplete, and broken into several fragments.
          The extant fragments are nevertheless enough for reconstructing the main structure and
          functions of the mechanism: it had several pointers, interconnected and worked by toothed
          gearing, showing the positions of the moon and sun (and probably also the planets) in the
          zodiac, the approximate date according to a lunisolar calendar, several subsidiary dials
          showing calendrical phenomena, and also predictions of eclipses.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-reference-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2">The longitudes of the sun and moon were shown on a single dial with two
          concentric rings: the inner one was divided into the twelve zodiac signs of 30 degrees
          each, and the outer one into 12 months of 30 days each plus five epagomenal days that
          constitute a year according to the Egyptian calendar. One pointer rotated one turn per
          year, showing the position of the sun in the zodiac; probably the same pointer<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-reference-4">4</a></sup>
          showed also the day in the calendar ring. A second pointer rotated one turn per sidereal
          month, showing the position of the moon in the zodiac.</p>
<p id="p3">The moon pointer included a delightful and prominent detail, partially conserved
          in the back of Fragment C. See <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>. One half of a small ball
          was seen in a small circular window. The ball was half pale and half dark, and it rotated
          with the lunar synodic period and so showed the phases of the moon. The device was mounted
          on a small cap, rotating with the lunar sidereal period, to which the (lost) moon pointer
          was probably attached. See <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>. The moon ball was connected
          to a contrate gear through an arbor. This contrate was driven, either directly or
          indirectly, by a gear rotating with the solar period. Consequently the ensemble functioned
          as a differential gear, so that the contrate–and with it the little ball– rotated at a
          rate that was the difference between those of the sun and the moon pointers. Its period of
          rotation was therefore the synodic period, representing the elongation of the moon from
          the sun.</p>

<p id="p4">Not having understood the detail of this assembly, Derek de Solla Price (1974:
          20) suggested two possible functions for it: 1) it could be “some part of the dial work
          for the center of the front dial, possibly a plate indicating the position of the Moon” or
          2) “a crank handle ... that drives the contrate wheel A”. (This refers not to the contrate
          in Fragment C, of which Price was unaware, but another contrate in Fragment A.) Price's
          first proposal was close to the truth, but he related the device only the moon's position,
          not with the moon's phases. In any case, Price only mentioned these possibilities, without
          developing them any further.</p>
<p id="p5">Michael Wright presented a reconstruction of the component as the boss of the
          pointer for the Moon’s position, incorporating a display of the Moon’s phase,<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-reference-5">5</a></sup>
          and since then scholars have universally accepted this reconstruction. It could not have
          been otherwise, because Wright's proposal makes perfect sense and it fits very well with
          the physical evidence of the extant cap: even to the naked eye, it is easy to see not only
          the circular window, but also a smooth hemispherical depression behind the circular hole
          that strongly suggests that the hole was once filled by the small lunar ball. The arbor
          connecting the place of the ball with the contrate gear is also there, and even around
          half of the contrate. There is further evidence confirming Wright's proposal, for in the
          portion of the Back Cover Inscription preserved on Fragment B of the Mechanism a "small
          golden sphere" probably refers to the sun, while in a more broken context that was
          probably describing the lunar display another "small sphere" is mentioned with which the
          word “black” is most likely associated.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-reference-6">6</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6">However, the contrate is found with its teeth pointing away from the centre of
          the cap, not towards it as Wright’s reconstruction requires (see <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>). Wright suggests that this component, as found, had been inserted the
          wrong way round: “It seems therefore that the Antikythera Mechanism suffered the
          indignity, depressingly common in the author’s experience as curator of a collection of
          mechanism, of having been taken apart and reassembled incorrectly” (Wright 2006: 327).</p>

</figure>
<p id="p7">Tony Freeth has proposed an alternative solution according to which the gear, as
          found, is correctly placed.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-reference-7">7</a></sup> Two more gears are added, connecting the contrate gear
          (with its teeth pointing away from the axis) to a gear fixed on the solar axis (see <a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>). Gear <i>u</i> is fixed to the solar axis and therefore
          rotates with the solar period. Gear <i>u</i> moves <i>x</i> which has the same number of
          teeth, so that it rotates at the same rate but in the opposite direction. Gear <i>y</i>,
          which is fixed to <i>x</i>, rotating at the same rate, has the same number of teeth as the
          contrate (<i>z</i>) with which it is engaged. This device produces exactly the same result
          as Wright’s proposal, while allowing the teeth of the contrate to be in the extant
          direction.</p>

<img src="images/figure04.png"/>
<figcaption><b>Figure 4</b>: Freeth's proposal for connecting the contrate gear to the sun
            axis.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="p8">Freeth's proposal is the simplest solution to the problem if, as we will show,
          there are compelling reasons to consider that the incorrect reassembly proposal should be
          discarded. But an obvious question still remains: why would the Antikythera Mechanism's
          maker prefer this more complicated solution to the simpler one proposed by Wright? We know
          from many other features of the mechanism that the builder was very smart, and reasonably
          minimalist, even using in several instances parts of the same gear train for different
          purposes. Therefore, there must be a reason for using four instead of two gears.</p>
<p id="p9">In this paper, we will offer for the first time a detailed description of the
          remains of the moon ball mechanism as it can be seen in the CT data, trying to make sense
          of every feature (section 1). This examination will incidentally show the surprising
          intricacy of the tiny components of this apparatus, some of which must have been custom
          designed for this application. Then we will consider, in the light of this analysis,
          whether it is possible that the extant contrate gear direction is not the originally
          intended one, and we will show that the proposal of incorrect reassembly should be
          discarded (section 2). Finally we will offer a conjectural explanation for a modified
          version of Freeth’s configuration (section 3).</p>

<h3>Description of evidence</h3>
<p id="p11">We have used photographs, PTMs, and CT to examine the physical remains.
          Measurements were made using the ruler tool included in 3D Slicer 4.4.0 software on the
          CT. We give our measurements to the nearest tenth of a millimeter. We estimate that most
          of our measurements are probably accurate to a few tenths of a millimeter.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-reference-8">8</a></sup> In
          a mechanism such as the moon phase device with its small pieces it would be desirable to
          have a greater degree of accuracy but, as Freeth and Jones (2012: <a href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/4/#p118">#p118</a>) noted, “the features
          … in the fragments are invariably heavily corroded, they are often affected by heavy
          calcification and they are sometimes broken”. In order to specify the directions of the
          pieces of the device, we will always determine them as viewed from the Mechanism's
          "inside", i.e., as we actually see them in photos of Fragment C (face C-2), schemes and
          drawings (see, for example, <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>.</p>
<p id="p12">The moon phase device is mounted on a <b>circular plate</b> (plate thickness:
          1.4 mm) with a radius of about 33.8 mm. The plate is colored red in the diagram of <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>; see also <a href="#figure06">Figure 6</a>. The plate has
          a rim in its border 7.1 mm high and with the same width as the plate so that the radius of
          the plate inside the rim is about 32.5 mm. The rim is not complete and has suffered
          obvious damage, especially in the zone close to the moon ball. The missing rim extends
          from around 23° counterclockwise of the arbor to 73.4° clockwise. Notwithstanding this
          gap, it seems probable that the rim was originally complete in the zone near where the
          moon ball was, since the missing moon pointer was probably aligned with the arbor, and so
          should have been attached in some way to the rim in this place. (There are no traces of
          features to hold the pointer at a level close to the moon plate.)</p>
<p id="p13">In the inner part of the plate is the footprint of what seems to have been
          another <b>rim</b> that intentionally formed an incomplete circular arc. This rim was not
          concentric with the plate. Its center is in the line of the axis of the arbor, but 4.2 mm
          from the center of the moon cap in the direction of the moon ball.  The footprint has an
          inner radius of 14.2 mm and an outer radius of 16.4 mm. The arc is open where it would
          otherwise pass through the arbor window (described below). The opening of the arc is 41.5°
          on each side of the arbor's axis. See <a href="#figure07">Figure 7</a>. Similar rims are
          preserved attached (apparently by solder) to the base plate in Fragment A, where they
          served to stabilize large gears in planes parallel to the base plate. Following Wright
          (Wright 2006: 328-329) we refer to them as <i>curbs</i> (or, in Wright's English spelling,
            <i>kerbs</i>).</p>
<p id="p14">In the center of the plate is a <b>squared hole</b> of side around 3 mm (the
          side closer to the plane of the arbor is 2.9 mm long, while the side perpendicular to that
          one is 3.2 mm long.) The arbor that turned the moon cap and with it the moon pointer
          passed through this hole. The hole is not aligned with the arbor of the moon ball;
          relative to the arbor its sides are rotated 19.5° counterclockwise. (We do not see any
          particular significance in this non-alignment.) See <a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>,
          reference A.</p>
<p id="p15">Close to the squared hole and beyond it with respect to the contrate gear, there
          is a clear <b>Tau</b> inscribed on the inner surface of the plate. It is roughly aligned
          with the arbor axis but slightly rotated counterclockwise with respect to the plane of the
          arbor axis, but not as much as the squared hole. Its base is 2.7 mm distant from the
          border of the hole. It is 2.3 mm high and 2.5 mm wide. The purpose of this inscription is
          not certain, but was probably a symbol for identifying where the part belonged for
          purposes of assembly (Price 1974: 20 and Freeth and Jones 2012: #p376). See <a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>, reference B.</p>
<p id="p16">The cap plate is traversed by another <b>large window</b> with a complex shape.
           See <a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>, references 1, 2, 3 and 4. The window's long
          dimension runs along part of a radius of the plate, starting a couple of millimeters from
          the squared window and extending right to the rim. The window's shape is symmetrical with
          respect to this radius. For convenience of description we will treat the window as
          comprising four distinct sections. From the center to the border, these are as follows:
           1) The first section is the smallest; it is just one millimeter long and 2.7 mm wide. It
          was presumably intended to accommodate the tip of the arbor that extended beyond the
          contrate gear (see <a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>, reference 1). The wall of the window
          that is nearest to the plate's center is not perpendicular to the plane of the cap plate
          but tilts such that, while the hole is 1 mm long at the inner surface of the plate, it is
          1.4 mm long at the outer surface (see <a href="#figure09">Figure 9</a>). 2) The second
          section was intended to house the contrate gear. It is 5.7 mm long and 11.5 mm wide (see
            <a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>, reference 2). 3) The third section housed the arbor;
          it is 14.9 mm long and 3.3 mm wide (see <a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>, reference 3). 4)
          The final section is the circular moon ball window, with a diameter of about 8.1 mm. The
          border of this part of the window is damaged, especially to the left of the arbor (see <a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>, reference 4).</p>
<p id="p17">The <b>arbor</b> (blue in the diagram of <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>) is
          22.4 mm long and 1.7 mm wide. It is broken into two pieces (<a href="#figure10">Figure
            10</a>, reference 1). The smaller is around 6.4 mm long and is closer to the center of
          the moon cap; the larger is 16 mm long. In the smaller piece, the arbor has a rectangular
          cross-section. After the break, the arbor is cylindrical. The smaller part holds the
          contrate gear; just a small part of the arbor towards the center of the cap plate projects
          about 0.8 mm beyond the contrate gear (<a href="#figure10">Figure 10</a>, reference 4).
          This tip is located in the first section of the arbor window. 1.3 mm from this end, the
          arbor is perforated crossways by a pinhole of 0.8 mm diameter (<a href="#figure10">Figure
            10</a>, reference 2). The hole is exactly aligned with a rectangular slot on the back
          face of the contrate gear (<a href="#figure10">Figure 10</a>, reference 3). The pin that
          the hole and slot were meant to accommodate is missing. The arbor has just enough space
          along its length to accommodate the contrate between the pinhole and a squared collar of
          sides 3.7 mm and 2.5 mm length along the axis of the arbor. This collar might have been a
          separate component attached in somehow to the arbor, but since close study of the CT does
          not show any traces of a boundary between the arbor and the collar, we believe that the
          collar is probably one piece with the arbor (see <a href="#figure11">Figure 11</a>). The
          break in the arbor comes right after the collar. Inside the collar the CT shows a small
          radiodense globule, almost spherical, with a diameter of roughly 1 mm, whose significance
          is not clear to us if it is not simply a bit of free metal that was protected from
          corrosion by the thickness of the collar (<a href="#figure10">Figure 10</a>, reference 6).
          After the break, as previously noted, the arbor is cylindrical, and is enclosed in a kind
          of pipe (the arbor keeper) that will be described later. The arbor, as it is preserved,
          continues a bit beyond the pipe and into the moon ball window, for less than a millimeter.
          In the arbor's interior, close to the break, is another radiodense globule with an
          elliptical shape (major axis 1.38 mm, minor axis 0.9 mm, <a href="#figure10">Figure
          10</a>, reference 7).</p>
<p id="p18">The <b>contrate</b> (blue in the diagram of <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>) is
          also broken. The extant part is almost exactly half of the complete gear and is located
          above the plate, i.e., in the face of the plate opposite to that of the rim. The gear has
          an outer diameter of 11.2 mm, an inner diameter of 7 mm, and a width of 5.2 mm (see <a href="#figure12">Figure 12</a>). As already mentioned, the back face of the gear
          (opposite to that of the teeth) is crossed diametrically by a rectangular slot 1.3 mm wide
          and 0.8 mm high, which is aligned with the pinhole of the arbor, and thus would have
          allowed the gear to be fixed to the arbor by means of a pin (<a href="#figure10">Figure
            10</a>, reference 3). Ten teeth of the gear have survived. The distance from tooth
          valley to tooth valley is approximately 1.7 mm, which is consistent with a complete tooth
          count of 20. The high of the teeth is also on average 1.7 mm.</p>
<p id="p19">Attached to the inner part of the cap plate and along each side of the third
          section of the big window, i.e. the arbor window, are two pieces of metal (green in the
          diagram of <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>), mirror-images of each other, that extend
          almost the whole length of the arbor window (leaving just 0.5 mm of the window free, at
          the end closer to the contrate). See <a href="#figure13">Figure 13</a>. Each of these
          pieces has a complex shape in which it is possible to distinguish two parts: 1) closer to
          the contrate is a long rectangle that we will call, following Wright’s terminology, a
            “<b>cheek</b>” (Wright 2006: 326) (<a href="#figure13">Figure 13</a>, reference 1), and
          2) adjoined to it (and probably making just one metal piece with the cheek) a cube with a
          pinhole that we will call the “<b>holder</b>” (<a href="#figure13">Figure 13</a>,
          reference 2). The cheeks are 10 mm long, 3.2 mm wide, and 1.2 mm high. They are 2.1 mm
          apart, so they partially cover the arbor window, which is 3.3 mm wide. Each cheek has a
          small, clearly intentional indent like a very shallow groove running along the side that
          is partially closing the window. This depression is 0.6 mm wide and just 0.4 mm deep. The
          depression is as wide as the part of the cheek that overhangs the window. The initial
          impression obtained from CT or photographs is that the depression is present along just
          the first 4.1 mm of the cheek closest to the contrate gear; however, closer inspection of
          the CT shows that the depression –with the same width and depth– continues all the way to
          the holders, but is covered along the part towards the moon window by a thin tab of metal
          that belongs to the arbor keeper pipe—to be described later—and not to the cheeks (see <a href="#figure14">Figure 14</a>). At the extremity of each cheek closer to the moon ball
          is located the second part of this component, the <i>holder</i>. The cheeks suddenly
          increase in height in a vertical wall, reaching 2.9 mm height. See <a href="#figure13">Figure 13</a>, reference 2. The holders are 4.4 mm long, and are slightly narrower than
          the rest of the cheeks by 0.6 mm, so that they do not cover any part of the third section
          of the window, but exactly follow its borders. The holders are perforated by a pinhole
          (still containing remains of the pin). See <a href="#figure13">Figure 13</a>, reference 5.
          The diameter of the pinhole is 0.7 mm and its center is located 1.1 mm from the plate and
          2.1 mm from the beginning of the holder (i.e., from the wall of the holder where the cheek
          changes its height). We note in passing that the removable pins used here and elsewhere in
          the Mechanism were evidently composed of a different alloy from the components in which
          they were inserted, so that pinholes are very conspicuous in the CT whether or not the
          pins themselves survive (Anastasiou et al. 2014).</p>
<p id="p20">There is a very clear <b>hemispherical depression</b> where the moon ball ought
          once to have been (blue in the diagram of <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>; see <a href="#figure15">Figure 15</a>). This could be remains of the surface of the moon ball
          (in which case the ball must either have been hollow or partly covered by some kind of
          lamination overlaying half of it) or just accretion that assumed this semicircular shape
          by building up in contact with the missing ball. We find such accretion layers in many
          places in the Mechanism's fragments; for example, the mirror image inscriptions on
          fragment A and B are due to accretion against the original inscribed plates (cfr. Price
          1974: 47). The diameter of the depression is 6 mm, significantly smaller than the moon
          ball window. It is roughly centered in the moon ball window. (It is hard to determine the
          exact center of the moon window because it is damaged.) As we have already said, the arbor
          protrudes a bit beyond the arbor keeper and projects inside the moon ball window.
          Nevertheless, the arbor does not quite reach the moon ball depression. But, if we imagine
          extending the arbor to where the arbor should come into contact for the first time with
          the moon ball, there is a very small semicircular indentation in the rim of the moon ball
          depression perfectly lined up with and of about the same size as the arbor, which seems to
          confirm that the arbor originally went inside the ball (see <a href="#figure16">Figure
            16</a>). There is also a slight semicircular depression at the other side that might
          suggest that the arbor, after going through the entire ball, protruded from it. This
          depression, however, is less regular and not as well aligned as the previous one, so it
          may be just a random irregularity.  </p>
<p id="p21">Inside the arbor window and between the two cheeks and their holders is another
          component that kept the arbor in place. We will call it the <b>arbor keeper pipe</b>, or
          simply, the pipe (violet in the diagram of <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>). This pipe
          has a complex shape (somewhat similar to a tobacco pipe with a bowl) that makes it fit
          perfectly in the space left by the moon window, the cheeks and holders (see <a href="#figure17">Figure 17</a>). It is 14.9 mm long (hence it goes all along the third
          section of the big window). It is perforated by a cylindrical hole of the same diameter as
          the arbor, which is inside it (<a href="#figure17">Figure 17</a>, reference 1). The pipe
          covers the arbor window and slightly protrudes from the outer surface of the cap plate, by
          about 0.8 mm. On this face it has a regular semi-cylindrical shape. The “bowl” of the pipe
            (<a href="#figure17">Figure 17</a>, reference 2), 6.4 mm high and as long as the holders
          (4.4 mm), is lodged between the two holders and is a bit taller than them (about 1.3 mm).
          This part covers all the space between the two holders (3.3 mm). It also has a pinhole
          aligned with the pinhole of the holders and of the same diameter (<a href="#figure17">Figure 17</a>, reference 3). The shape of the sides of the “shank” of the pipe has been
          executed in such a way that they perfectly fit with the sides of the window and the part
          of the cheeks that partially covered the window. Thus, the two vertical walls of the shank
          have a depression that accommodates the protruding parts of the cheeks (see <a href="#figure13">Figure 13</a>). Part of the depression is finished with little “wings”
          that cover the small depressions of the cheeks, so that the exposed top surface of the
          pipe constitutes a flat tab flush with the exposed top surfaces of the cheeks. There
          appears to be a second letter Tau shallowly inscribed on the tab, with its top horizontal
          stroke running along the tab's right edge (Wright 2006: 326 Figure 8). These wings extend
          from the bowl of the pipe for 4.1 mm (see <a href="#figure14">Figure 14</a>). We already
          mentioned them when we observed that, because of them, there is a false appearance that
          the depression of the cheeks did not extend along the whole length of the cheeks. The
          complete shape of the arbor keeper pipe can be seen in the following animation.</p>
<p id="p22">This completes our description of the evidence that can be obtained by accurate
          analysis of the CT. Now we will try to make sense of this description.</p>

<h3>Reconstruction of the Mechanism</h3>
<p id="p23">The general way that the moon phase mechanism works is clear and was first
          correctly described by Michael Wright (2006: 327-329). As we already mentioned, the
          contrate gear must rotate with the lunar synodic period. The gear is attached to the arbor
          through a pin and so the arbor also rotates at the same rate. The arbor is held by pipe
          and transmits its rotation to the moon ball.</p>
<p id="p24">We will propose a way in which all the parts of the mechanism can be assembled
          and disassembled that is consistent with the description of the parts and makes sense of
          some apparently unnecessary complexities in certain pieces (such as the particular shape
          of the cheeks or of the pipe). See animation 2. In order to disassemble the mechanism:</p>
<ol id="ol1">
<li id="li1">You first have to detach the moon ball. The moon ball was presumably attached
            to the the part of the arbor inserted in it just by friction or possibly a screw
            fitting. The small semicircular slot at the moon ball depression where the arbor should
            go inside the ball (<a href="#figure16">Figure 16</a>) shows that the arbor was still
            cylindrical when went inside the ball (this would have allowed one to twist the ball by
            hand when the apparatus was assembled and all the gears connected, in order to set up
            the correct phase). Because the moon ball is smaller than the moon ball window, the ball
            could be taken off by drawing it in the opposite direction of the arbor.</li>
<li id="li2">Then you have to remove the pin that goes through the holders and the pipe.
            Steps 1 and 2 could be reversed, but both must be completed before step 3.</li>
<li id="li3">The third step consists in removing the entire apparatus: i.e., the pipe with
            the arbor and the contrate. The walls of the pipe are as wide as the space left by the
            third section of the moon window, but the window is partially closed by the cheeks,
            which thus prevent the pipe from being pushed through to the inner side of the plate. On
            the other hand, the wings of the pipe prevent it from being pushed through towards the
            outer side of the plate. Consequently, even if the pin is removed, the pipe cannot be
            moved up or down. But, now that the pin and the moon ball have been removed, the pipe
            can be slid in the direction of the moon window using the protruded part of the cheeks
            as guides. If the pipe is moved in this way until it abuts the rim of the cap, the part
            of the shank of the pipe that has wings would be now partially in the moon ball window
            and partially in the part of the third section window where the holders are, and so the
            cheeks would not stand in the way of moving the pipe to the outer side of the plate. It
            is important to realize that even now it can only be removed in the direction of the
            outer part and not towards the inner part of the plate, because the shank still is wider
            than the space left by the cheeks.</li>
<li id="li4">Once the pipe, together with the arbor and the gear, has been removed from
            the moon cap, you can extract the arbor by drawing it in the direction of the gear (you
            cannot remove it in the other direction because the squared collar obstructs it).</li>
<li id="li5">Finally you can remove the pin that fixes the gear to the arbor and take off
            the gear (the order of steps 4 and 5 can be reversed). The whole mechanism is now
            disassembled. You can reassemble the mechanism following the steps in the reverse
            order.</li>

<section id="section2">
<h2>Section 2: the direction of the contrate gear</h2>
<p id="p25">In this section we will analyse in detail whether, as Wright suggested, the
          contrate gear was reassembled incorrectly so that the actual direction of the contrate
          gear is not the originally intended one, or whether the extant direction was the intended
          one so that we would have to postulate (at a minimum) two extra gears to connect the
          contrate gear to the Sun's arbor, as Freeth suggested.</p>
<p id="p26">We note in passing that that the supposed incorrect assembly must have taken
          place before the discovery of the shipwreck and not, say, during handling or conservation
          of the fragment at the Museum. The earliest known photograph of the face of Fragment C
          bearing the Moon phase apparatus, published by Svoronos in 1903, shows it before any
          conservation work had been done on it, and the contrate gear is clearly visible pointing
          in the extant direction (see <a href="#figure18">Figure 18</a>). It also seems very
          unlikely that an inversion of the gear could have happened during the shipwreck or during
          the time the Mechanism was under the sea. The perfect alignment of the pinhole of the
          arbor and the pin slot of the contrate on one side, and the almost perfect alignment of
          the two pieces of the arbor on each side of the break make the notion that the contrate
          gear was somehow flipped around just by chance highly implausible. The incorrect assembly
          must have taken place before the shipwreck, when the Mechanism was essentially intact.</p>

            contrate's orientation is the same as today.</figcaption></figure>
<p id="p27">In <a href="#figure19">Figure 19</a> we schematically represent the parts that
          would play a role in this analysis in the extant position, i.e., with the contrate gear
          teeth facing the moon ball.</p>
<figure id="figure19">

<figcaption><b>Figure 19</b>: Schematic reconstruction of the moon phase device as extant
            in fragment C. Note the three points labeled a, b and c. A break in the arbor is clearly
            visible between b and c.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="p28">If one wants to assert that the gear has been reversed before the shipwreck
          there are three options. The first two can be easily dismissed by consideration of the
          evidence, but the third one will require a more detailed analysis. The first option
          consists of reconstructing the intended arrangement of the moon phase mechanism by leaving
          all as in <a href="#figure19">Figure 19</a> except the gear, which would face the other
          way around. But, as is evident from <a href="#figure20">Figure 20</a>, if you keep the
          pinhole of the arbor aligned with the slot of the gear so that the pin can be inserted,
          the gear would not fit inside the gear-window of the moon cap. An additional problem is
          that the gear would be too close to the sun axis to leave room for a gear with the same
          number of teeth that would move the contrate gear.</p>
<figure id="figure20">
<img src="images/figure20.png"/>
<figcaption><b>Figure 20</b>: Option 1: the contrate is facing the other direction,
            keeping all the other elements in their places. The gear does not fit in the
            gear-window.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="p29">The second option assumes that the collar was movable. According to this
          possibility, the collar would have originally been between the contrate and edge a of the
          window. This option would make all the components fit within the cap window. The collar
          would have had to have a hole for a pin (d in <a href="#figure21">Figure 21</a>) that,
          passing through the collar and the extant pinhole of the arbor, would fix the collar.
          Also, the arbor would have to have had another pinhole (e in <a href="#figure21">Figure
            21</a>) for a second pin that, passing through it and the rectangular slot in the gear,
          would prevent the gear from moving to the right. The absence of any traces of a boundary
          between the collar and the arbor, and above all of a second pinhole in the arbor at e or
          of a pinhole through the collar rules out this option, since, as previously noted, the
          pinholes in the Mechanism are conspicuous in the CT whether their pins are still present
          or not.</p>
<figure id="figure21">
<img src="images/figure21.png"/>
<figcaption><b>Figure 21</b>: Option 2: the contrate is facing the other direction and the
            collar is located between border a and the gear.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="p30">The third option takes advantage of the break between surfaces b and c.
          According to this proposal, in its original position the gear was reversed together with
          the broken part of the arbor between a and b and the collar attached to it (see <a href="#figure22">Figure 22</a>). Through some accident the arbor was broken, and
            <i>after this happened</i>, someone put the broken piece with the contrate back in its
          part of the window pointing the wrong way.</p>
<figure id="figure22">
<img src="images/figure22.png"/>
<figcaption><b>Figure 22</b>: the broken part of the arbor, together with the collar and
            the contrate gear, has been reversed.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="p31">The main problems that we find with this proposal are the following. First, a
          close inspection of the CT tends to confirm that there is a reasonably good matching break
          between b and c. See <a href="#figure23">Figure 23</a>.</p>
<figure id="figure23">
<img src="images/figure23.png"/>
<figcaption><b>Figure 23</b>: the matching between border b and c. Copyright of the
            Antikythera Mechanism Research Project.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="p32">Second, in the incorrect assembly hypothesis the most reasonable reconstruction
          suggests that the squared collar would have been at the left extremity of the arbor.
          Because the collar was one piece with the arbor, it doesn’t make sense for the arbor to
          protrude beyond the collar. Hence the little window that we identified as the first
          section of the big window would be pointless, as shown in <a href="#figure24">Figure
            24</a>:</p>
<figure id="figure24">
<img src="images/figure24.png"/>
<figcaption><b>Figure 24</b>: the arbor shouldn’t protrude beyond the collar.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="p33">On the other hand, according to the hypothesis that the contrate is preserved in
          its intended orientation, it is perfectly reasonable for a bit of the arbor to protrude
          beyond the gear window so that the pinhole in the arbor does not have to be too close to
          its end and so more liable to damage. The fact that the gear, instead of having a hole for
          the pin, has a slot could indicate that a hole so close to the edge would be very fragile.
          The same would be the case with an arbor that was as long as the gear, but not more.</p>
<p id="p34">Third, if the pinhole of the arbor was so close to the break, one would have
          expected the arbor have broken through the pinhole, since this was the most fragile part
          the arbor.</p>
<p id="p35">Fourth, there are distinct remains of the cylindrical arbor at the collar. In
          the following CT image the circle left by the joining of the squared collar and the
          cylindrical arbor is perfectly identifiable. It is clear from the CT that we are seeing
          surface b and not surface c.</p>

<figcaption><b>Figure 25</b>: remains of the cylindrical arbor at the collar, before the
            break. Copyright of the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="p36">Fifth, a close inspection of the break shows that it probably includes some
          little parts of the pipe itself, and not just the arbor. It would be very hard to explain
          on the incorrect reassembly hypothesis why the little broken pieces of the pipe are still
          in place. These broken parts of the pipe can be observed in two places. See <a href="#figure26">Figure 26</a> and <a href="#figure27">Figure 27</a>.</p>

            Project.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="p37">Sixth, if the contrate originally faced the center of the moon cap and then you
          attempted to reverse its orientation, the teeth of the gear attached to the solar arbor
          that originally moved the contrate would obstruct replacing the moon cap in its original
          place, because the back of the contrate would collide with its teeth.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-reference-9">9</a></sup>
          So, there are three possibilities. One is that the moon cap was never reinstalled on the
          Mechanism after the contrate gear was unintentionally reversed. But this is implausible,
          first because the moon cap is extant in fragment C, close to the zodiac and calendar
          rings, and second because the cap faces in the correct direction with respect to the outer
          part of the mechanism and the inscribed part of the rings face, which seems to indicate
          that it was in place at the moment of the shipwreck. Secondly, someone might have tried to
          force the cap into place, causing still more damage (as suggested by Wright 2006: 327),
          but this requires that the person responsible, feeling the resistance, was too careless to
          look for what was wrong and notice the obvious fact that the contrate was facing the wrong
          way to engage with the other gear. The third possibility is that the moon cap was indeed
          reassembled, but the gear attached to the solar arbor was for some unexplained reason also
          missing, but this is clearly an <i>ad hoc</i> hypothesis. (This objection would also apply
          to the second hypothesis involving a removable collar and second pin.)</p>
<p id="p38">Seventh, we should ask how it is that the broken part is in its place, so very
          well aligned with the rest of the arbor. We know that the part of the arbor closer to the
          moon ball was kept in place by the pipe, but the broken part of the arbor, the collar and
          the contrate gear itself would have had nothing to keep them in place. They ought to have
          fallen out.</p>
<p id="p39">These are the main difficulties of the incorrect assembly hypothesis. But our
          proposal also presents at least one difficulty with respect to the physical remains. If
          the extant position is the intended one, we have to postulate some additional lost
          gearwork to connect the solar arbor's motion to the contrate, most plausibly two extra
          gears, as Freeth suggested. But it seems that there is no trace of the loss of a part on
          which the arbor for the two extra gears could have been planted, and it is reasonable to
          think that it should have left a detectable trace. Based on his own study of the original
          fragment C, Wright has made the same point in connection with both Freeth’s reconstruction
          and the one discussed here (private communication). However, we see two possible ways that
          the extra gears could have been mounted, either by a platform soldered to the top faces of
          the cheeks (see Figure 29) or by an attachment to the curb whose footprint remains on the
          plate (see Figure 28).</p>
<figure id="figure28">

<figcaption><b>Figure 28</b>: Reconstruction of the rim attached to the moon cap. The
            extremities intersect the point at which the arbor of the two extra gears must be
            located and the opening is just the required to accommodate the gears. If a support of
            the arbor was necessary at the top of the gears for mechanical reasons, it could be
            easily added.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure id="figure29">

<figcaption><b>Figure 29</b>: Another way to fix the gears. The bridge holding the arbor
            of the two extra gears could be attached to the cheeks. If a support of the arbor was
            necessary at the top of the gears for mechanical reasons, it could be easily
            added.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="p40">A further reason for suspecting the presence of the two gears (or at least of
          something where the two extra gears should be) is the way in which the pipe is assembled
          and disassembled. We have already explained that, while the pin of the pipe must be
          removed from the inner part of the cap, the pipe has been designed in such a way that it
          could only be removed towards the outer part of the cap. In principle it would have been
          easier to remove both pieces from the same side. So, the fact that the pipe was designed
          to be removed to the outer face of the cap strongly suggests the presence of something in
          the inner part, blocking the passage of the pipe. See again animation 3 which is
          essentially similar to animation 2, but with the proposed gears added.</p>

<p id="p41">In conclusion, all the evidence seems to indicate that the arbor was broken
          after the shipwreck and that the extant position is the original and intended position. In
          what follows I will show that the Antikythera mechanism's maker could have had a good
          reason for putting the gear in this position.</p>

<section id="section3">
<h2>Section 3: non-uniform motion of the moon phase ball.</h2>
<p id="p42">Freeth’s proposal consists of two pairs of gears having an equal number of
          teeth. Fortunately, we have another example of this in the mechanism: the pin and slot
          device for producing the lunar anomalistic motion. The pin and slot device does not change
          the period of rotation, but produces a non-uniform motion in the output gear (see <a href="#figure30">Figure 30</a>). Gears <i>z</i> and <i>y</i> have the same number of
          teeth, as do gears <i>u</i> and <i>x</i>. <i>u</i> moves <i>x</i> by engagement, and
            <i>x</i> moves <i>y</i> by means of a pin inserted in a slot of <i>y</i>. Therefore,
            <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> rotate at the same rate but, because <i>y</i> is eccentric with
          respect to <i>x</i>, its motion is not uniform. This non-uniform motion is transmitted by
          engagement from <i>y</i> to <i>z</i>. Consequently <i>z</i> rotates at the same rate as
            <i>u</i>, but with a non-uniform motion. The amplitude of the non-uniformity depends on
          the eccentricity and its period is the period of rotation of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.</p>
<figure id="figure30">

<figcaption><b>Figure 30</b>: A schematic representation of the pin-and-slot device for
            the lunar anomaly.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="p43">Proposals have recently been published for extending the pin and slot device to
          produce the retrograde motion of outer and inner planets.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-reference-10">10</a></sup>
          It is thus possible that the pin and slot device was not exclusively employed for the
          lunar anomaly. If the designer intended to model some anomalistic period in the rotation
          of the moon ball, through the use of a pin and slot device, we would have an explanation
          for the presence of the two extra gears of Freeth’s arrangement (see <a href="#figure31">Figure 31</a>).</p>
<figure id="figure31">
<img src="images/figure31.png"/>
<figcaption><b>Figure 31</b>: modification of Freeth's proposal (<a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>) introducing the pin-and-slot device.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="p44">This conjectural pin-and-slot device would produce an anomaly with period equal
          to the synodic month in the rotation of the moon phase ball, without affecting the motion
          of the moon pointer (i.e., the lunar sidereal motion). So, we should ask: do we know of
          any ancient report of some sort of anomaly in the lunar phases with a period of a synodic
          month, independent of the lunar sidereal motion?</p>
<p id="p45">The answer is affirmative. We know from Aristarchus of Samos’s <i>On Sizes and
            Distances of the Sun and Moon </i>(Heath 1913) that, if we accept that the ratio between
          the Earth-Sun distance and the Earth-Moon distance is not too great, there would be a
          perceptible inequality in the moon’s phases. Aristarchus distinguished the dichotomy (when
          the boundary between the moon's dark and illuminated parts appears to be a straight line)
          from the quadrature (when the moon is exactly 90° elongation from the sun). According to
          Aristarchus, the dichotomy is not produced at quadrature, but 3° earlier at first quarter
          and 3° later at last quarter (see <a href="#figure32">Figure 32</a>).</p>
<figure id="figure32">
<img src="images/figure32.png"/>
<figcaption><b>Figure 32</b>: Difference between dichotomy and quadrature due to the small
            ratio of the earth-sun/earth moon distance.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="p46">If this appearance were to be modelled in the mechanism, the motion of the moon
          ball would have to be non-uniform: it should take more time to go from the first dichotomy
          to second dichotomy than from second to first. The difference between these two intervals,
          according to Aristarchus’s proposal, would be around 1 day.</p>
<p id="p47">Aristarchus’s ratio between the Earth-Sun distance and the Earth-Moon distance
          is not the only one attested in ancient texts, and in fact, together with that of Ptolemy
          (for whom it was almost the same), it is one of the greatest. Of course, the smaller the
          ratio, the bigger the effect. So, for example, for Eudoxus the ratio was 9:1, implying a
          difference between quadrature and dichotomy of more than 6°; for Phidias, Archimedes’s
          father, 12:1, implying a difference of almost 5°; for Eratosthenes the ratio is a bit
          bigger than 5:1, implying a difference of almost 11°; and for Hipparchus, it is
          approximately 7:1, implying a difference of almost 8°.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-11" id="footnote-reference-11">11</a></sup> See the following
          animation based on Phidias’s proportion.</p>

<figcaption><b>Animation 5</b>: The moon phase device and its relation with the Sun-Earth
            / Moon-Earth distance proportion. The animation assumes the ratio proposed by Phidias,
            12:1.</figcaption>
<!-- 12:1? -->
</figure>
<p id="p48">A one-day difference could be observed on the Mechanism. One would move the moon
          pointer until the moon ball shows the dichotomy, note which day is indicated on the
          Egyptian calendar scale (or on the day-of-the-month display, if such display existed, as
          has been proposed)<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-12" id="footnote-reference-12">12</a></sup>, then crank the mechanism forward to the next
          dichotomy and check the date. Of course, a crucial question is whether it could be
          possible to distinguish the dichotomy on the moon ball within one single day. Two
          independent observations have been made with different reconstructions of the mechanism,
          and in both cases the answer was positive.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-13" id="footnote-reference-13">13</a></sup> Moreover, the observations
          have been made assuming the maximum attested ratio of the distances (that of Aristarchus),
          but if the ratio between the distances was smaller, then the effect would be even greater
          and, therefore, easier to be detected.</p>
<p id="p49">We must stress that if the Mechanism's designer adopted Freeth's extra pair of
          gears, or indeed <i>any</i> means of transmitting motion from the solar arbor to the moon
          ball's arbor that was more complicated than the obvious direct engagement of the contrate
          with the fixed gear as proposed by Wright, it must have been intended somehow to modify
          the motion that direct engagement would have produced. The only possibilities are a
          modification of the period, which is out of the question for a display of the lunar
          phases, or a periodic modification of the moon ball's rate of rotation—in other words, a
          modification of the symmetrical periodic function that would otherwise correlate the
          appearance of the lunar phase to the moon's elongation from the sun. (Strictly, we should
          not speak without qualification of a change from uniform to non-uniform motion, since the
          elongation displayed on the Mechanism was already affected by the lunar anomaly, though
          likely not by the solar anomaly<sup><a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-14" id="footnote-reference-14">14</a></sup>.) And the <i>only</i>
          historically plausible anomalistic effect would have been the one produced by the ratio of
          the distances of the sun and moon. Incorporating this effect would have provided a way of
          including one of the main topics of ancient astronomy at least since Aristotle’s time, the
          distances of the luminaries, which would not otherwise have been present in the mechanism.
          Their <i>relative</i> distances would have been displayed qualitatively by the fact that
          the moon ball was closer to the dial's center (representing the earth) than the "golden
          little sphere" that apparently was mounted on the sun's pointer, but it would have been
          impracticable to set these spheres at the assumed ratio of their distances. If the
          Antikythera mechanism was intended as a teaching device (Jones 2012), a moon phase
          anomalistic device would thus have been a suitable springboard for explaining the
          luminaries' distances.</p>
<p id="p50">Previously, the pin and slot device has only been suggested as a mechanical
          expression of an epicyclic or eccentric geometrical system, which have no obvious
          relevance for lunar phases. There is, however, an isomorphism between the mechanical and
          the astronomical configuration. Figure 16 represents the hypothetical pin and slot device
          for producing the moon phase anomaly, considered in a frame of reference such that the
          axes E of the driving gear and M of the driven gear are stationary. The pin, S, thus
          revolves around axis E uniformly (relative to the motion that directly drives it) with the
          synodic period. The slot (in dashed lines) revolves around the other axis, M, with the
          same period, but with a non-uniform motion. The non-uniform motion of the slot represents
          the moon phase anomaly. This mechanical configuration has an astronomical interpretation:
          E represents the Earth; M, the Moon, and S, the Sun, in a frame of reference such that the
          Earth and Moon are both stationary, so that the Sun revolves around the Earth at a rate
          equal to the difference between its own sidereal speed and the moon's sidereal speed, i.e.
          with the lunar synodic period. The angle that represents the moon's phases is angle SME,
          i.e., the angle at the Moon between the Earth and the Sun, and the rate of increase of
          this angle incorporates a non-uniformity because the Sun revolves around the Earth and not
          around the Moon. In order to produce the correct anomaly, the proportion between the
          interaxial distance ME and the distance between the pin, S and its axis, E, should be the
          same as the proportion between the Earth-Moon distance and the Earth-Sun distance. The
          isomorphism is perfect.</p>

            astronomical configuration of the moon phases.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="p51">If this proposal is correct, then it shows the pin and slot device in a new and
          interesting light. Recently James Evans and one of us suggested that the epicycle and
          deferent system could have been originated using the pin and slot as an inspiration and
          not the other way around (Evans and Carman 2013). According to that proposal, pin and slot
          devices were conceived as a mechanical solution for producing anomalistic motions in
          geared mechanisms and then, looking at it, some geometer proposed the epicycle and
          deferent system. The use of the pin and slot for the moon phase would show some
          independence of the pin and slot device from the epicycle and deferent system: in some
          sense, the pin and slot device is even more versatile than the epicycle and deferent
          system, for it could be used for producing anomalies that could not be represented by
          epicycles.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-13"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-13">13</a></sup> One
          has been done by Michael and Anne Wright checking the date on the day-of-the-month scale,
          on October 15, 2012. He described the experiment in the following words: “Our procedure
          was as follows. I first set the dial, stopping a little short of the perceived moment of
          dichotomy. The backlash in the train allowed the observer to move the pointer on in the
          same direction until, as closely as he/she could judge, the display showed dichotomy.
          He/she then moved the pointer, first in one direction and then in the other, just until
          he/she considered that the display showed a departure from dichotomy, and at each such
          point I made a fine pencil-mark alongside the Moon pointer on the day-of-the-month scale.
          Each of us repeated the observation both at first-quarter and at last-quarter. At each
          trial the marks were separated by rather less than one day. That is, it appeared that each
          of us could detect the moment of dichotomy to within half a day” (personal communication).
          The other was performed by James Evans using the calendar ring for checking the date,
          during the same day and his answer was also positive. I thanks all three for their kind
          help.</p>
